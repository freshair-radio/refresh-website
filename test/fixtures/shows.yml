  description:  Eve was Framed is dedicated to showcasing the latest female talent whilst also digging back to the classics and the overlooked. From fempop to 90s female rap to up-and-coming women producers/ creators, be ready to listen to both the underdogs and the icons. Everyone and anyone is welcome to listen to the eclectic number of genres weâ€™ll be playing including rnb, pop, garage, soul, carnival house, reggaton and more. Interlacing the music will be light discussion on ongoing feminist topics from across the globe which strive to provide food for thought.
