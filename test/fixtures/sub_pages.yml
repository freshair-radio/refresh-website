    <p><strong>Q. I can’t make my show this week. What should I do?</strong><br>
    A. Contact your producer and Head of Programming. Please do this with plenty of notice and for good reason!</p>

    <p><strong>Q. How many people are listening to my show?</strong><br>
    A. We don’t make listening figures available because we believe that
    student radio should be about creativity and gaining experience, not
    ego! But bear in mind that your show is going out in union buildings
    which see a huge amount of students through the doors. </p>

    <p><strong>Q. I need DJs for an event. Can anyone at FreshAir do it?</strong><br>
    A. Speak to our Head of Events who has a DJ roster and can spread the
    word on your event to get appropriate DJs based on availability, genre
    etc. </p>

    <p><strong>Q. I really want to go to this training event but I’m not sure I can afford it. Can FreshAir help?</strong><br>
    A. FreshAir has a discretionary fund available to fund members looking
    to go to training events that have been publicised by the station. We
    can’t give you the whole amount and funding is at the discretion of
    treasurer and manager based on a number of factors, but we might be able
    to help you out. Check out the relevant page in this members section.</p></div>
