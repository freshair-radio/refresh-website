Despite being an intimate venue, with the stage only a metre or so above audience level, King Tut&rsquo;s has hosted many notable acts on their paths to musical fame; the recent &lsquo;Supersonic&rsquo; documentary reveals that it was at this particular venue that Oasis was discovered and signed to Creation records. On the stairs up to the gig venue one can see a seemingly endless chronological list of incredible bands and artists who have taken to the stage. (My personal favourites include Blur, Elastica and The Strokes).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cigarettes After Sex open their set with a slow, dreamy rendition of &lsquo;Starry Eyes&rsquo; from the band&rsquo;s first EP. Lead singer Greg Gonzalez&rsquo;s vocals drone over relaxing bass lines and delicate drum rhythms conveying a sense of tenderness and emotional sincerity. The band also perform single they had released just the week before, called &lsquo;K&rsquo;, and an unreleased track &lsquo;Sunset&rsquo;. In an interview with KA Radio Scotland, Gonzalez describes drawing influence from the electronic sound of New Order and the introspective lyrics of The Smiths. For several audience members, seeing Cigarettes After Sex perform live was an emotionally intense experience - some even left the show with tears streaming from their eyes as the band closed with &lsquo;Nothing&rsquo;s Gonna Hurt You Baby&rsquo;. Despite not visiting Edinburgh on this world tour, Cigarettes After Sex will be back to perform at The Caves next April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/37/content_rs-225066-Cigarettes-After-Sex.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 420px;\" /></p>\r\n', 3, 1, '2016-11-28 00:00:00', '2017-10-21 21:33:33', 'cigarettes-after-sex-at-king-tut-s-wah-wah-hut', 1, NULL, 0),

This is your first time playing in the U.K, how are the shows going so far?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cleo: We&rsquo;ve played one show in Brighton last night. It was super fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harmony: It was really fun, it was the first time we&rsquo;ve ever gotten an encore, it was really weird.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C: It was so funny we played almost all of our songs, we don&rsquo;t have a ton of songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H: Yeah it was really cool. It was really trippy, it&rsquo;s our first show here and we didn&rsquo;t know what to expect and it was so cool, it was awesome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How and why did you two decide to start Girlpool?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>C: Harmony and I were going to shows at this space called The Smell in Los Angeles really often. We played in two different bands and overlapped and played similar shows. I left my band and we started playing together. We decided to start something where we could wrote songs that are very honest rather than just creating for others to lo like. We wanted to start a project that had a specific intention of being honest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H: I think we just wanted a lot of sincerity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Your lyrical honesty and frankness is something that&rsquo;s really refreshing, especially in guitar music where this is often shied away from. Why do you think this is?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>H: I think there&rsquo;s a lot of culture around being cool and that can be a part of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C: I feel like people always say it&rsquo;s a strange time for music because of what&rsquo;s happening right now. Like what&rsquo;s the wave, what&rsquo;s the scene?. Everyone&rsquo;s in this niche and finding their own groove to ride. I feel like for very popular bands right now, cool is something that&rsquo;s important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H: Yeah, it&rsquo;s difficult how much music culture interacts with image culture as an artist. Because of that image bypasses what the music is and it becomes a much bigger monster than it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C: Especially in Los Angeles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H: It can be really disappointing and distressing and uncomfortable. I think image has the most to do with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZP6ljoc-qQI\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<b>You&rsquo;re often described as a &lsquo;feminist band&rsquo;, do you take any grievance with being put in one category at all?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>C: Yeah. Being labeled as one specific thing, regardless, can be frustrating. Both of us have struggled with that. There&rsquo;s a few songs on the E.P that talk about gender and stuff, so we are doing other things and moving onwards. It&rsquo;s frustrating to be labelled as one thing when your entire being is a million different things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H: it&rsquo;s also lke when you&rsquo;re creating you don&rsquo;t have an agenda or are propagandising, you&rsquo;re just doing your thing honestly. When people take what you do honestly and make an expectation of you, that&rsquo;s unfair to the rest of your honest being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>This year people are becomming more and more vocal about gross sexism in alternative music. Have you ever experienced this in the way that people treat you at gigs or how journalists write about you (e.g The Guardian&rsquo;s description of you as &lsquo;shrieking&rsquo;).</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>C: We haven&rsquo;t experienced that a whole lot, just a few times. I always say I wasn&rsquo;t made aware of my gender until I started a band. It&rsquo;s only happened in some articles, like The Guardian one and being called a girl band is always aggravating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H: Sound people do it the most.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C: It&rsquo;s not something that makes us want to write songs about it more. It&rsquo;s just like, ok stop it go away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Do you think that there&rsquo;s any way we can change this culture around women in music, as artists, writers and fans?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>H: Yeah, just forget that it&rsquo;s women in music, it&rsquo;s human beings in music. Whatever you identify as, it shouldn&rsquo;t affect what your creation is seen as and I think that that goes for all types of art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C: It&rsquo;s frustrating to be called a girl playing music, or girl punk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H: We&rsquo;re just people doing our stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>So your E.P is out right now in the U.K and it is excellent but what&rsquo;s next?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>C: YES!! We&rsquo;re ready for it, bring it on! We&rsquo;re coming out with an album in spring, we&rsquo;ve been writing and writing and writing and are super exciting to share it with everyone. There will definitely be more uk and eurpean tours!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Finally, we&rsquo;d like to know who you think that we should be listening to from L.A or the States?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simultaneously: Radiator Hospital</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H: Alex G, Quarterbacks</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C: Steven Steinbrink, Told Slant, Frankie Cosmos</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/38/content_girlpool_wide-5851ac05ef17179d09ba5722bf3bf5ae6a26f3fc.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 450px;\" /></p>\r\n', 2, 1, '2016-09-08 23:00:00', '2017-10-18 21:05:55', 'interview-girlpool', 1, NULL, 0),

It&rsquo;s been three years since the last one &ndash; what have you been up to?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were kind of touring for the last year and a half or so and then yeah we jumped in, we rented our studio and started working on new songs but at the same time we were still playing quite a lot of European festivals. Then we went straight to New York and after that was like about a year down the line and working on the record and going a bit mental! And yeah then we recorded the record and pretty much went straight back into a rehearsal space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=%2Famy-abeyawardene%2Fkatherine-durrell-freshair-music-team-interviews-igor-from-daughter%2F&amp;hide_cover=1&amp;light=1\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So I see right now you&rsquo;re touring Europe and then you&rsquo;ve got some stuff in the UK and then it looks like you&rsquo;re back off to the US?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah and that kind of brings us to December and then we&rsquo;ll probably take a bit of a break.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It sounds well deserved! So how do you find the different countries compare in terms of touring- is the audience pretty similar everywhere or are there different vibes?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Um there&rsquo;s definitely different vibes country to country. I think it has a lot to do with the culture of every country and how they behave in everyday life. Like generally down south in Europe it&rsquo;s pretty very warm kind of crowds and really happy to be there. Then up in the UK it&rsquo;s like a little bit&hellip;little bit quieter, but it also depends on what day of the week it is. If it&rsquo;s the weekend people are generally a lot rowdier and up for it. I think it also has to do with like whether people are into like going to gigs that much. Obviously like in London people just are so used to have everything so available that there&rsquo;s like a little bit more of an &ldquo;Impress Me&rdquo; kind of attitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is there any area you&rsquo;ve not been yet that you&rsquo;ve got your eye on?</strong> Definitely South America &ndash; that&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;re very keen on going to at some point. We&rsquo;ve never been as people or as a band so that would be really nice. It&rsquo;s nice going back to places too to get to discover more than just a snapshot. Canada is lovely, so is Australia and Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We&rsquo;re looking forwards to seeing you in Scotland soon &ndash; how do you find it?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah it&rsquo;s always been so nice there. I think like it&rsquo;s such a lovely bunch of people and they tend to be quite quiet. We&rsquo;ve played Glasgow quite a lot between our own shows and opening for other bands. Our guitar tech lives in Glasgow and we&rsquo;ve worked with many Scottish people along the way so it&rsquo;s always really nice to come back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You&rsquo;ve got Wilsen as your opening act, how is that going?</strong> She&rsquo;s someone that we&rsquo;ve known for quite a while now and she&rsquo;s opened for us in the UK quite a few times already. She makes beautiful music that has such a special, intimate thing about it. Her new album is amazing and it&rsquo;s such an honour to have her with us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So going back to the new album &ndash; how does the writing process work?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s very much Elena doing the lyrics. I personally focus very much on the music. I have conversations about the lyrics because of my role as a producer but it&rsquo;s very much a thing that is hers. What is interesting for us as musicians was that Elena was being a lot more direct with her lyrics so then it was like how do you support that in a musical way just because before it was always kind of stranded approach. It was more about being evocative with the music, but this time around it was more just about entering into the lyrics and translating directly what she was saying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you have any favourites on the album?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>They all have a special place but I think Mothers was one that took a really long time to get to where it is so I have a special bit of my heart for that one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The video for No Care has a really interesting effect with all of the different shots and lighting. What was the process of making it like?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We just knew we wanted something that was quite fast paced and frenetic but then after that we just kind of let Jamie (the director) do his thing. So much of it has to do with the editing up until the point of getting the first edit we didn&rsquo;t actually know what it was going to look like. We obviously said sort of what we wanted it to look like but that was kind of a surprise but it turned out great. We were very happy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the story behind the album art?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The artist is someone from Brighton, Sarah Shaw. My girlfriend introduced me to her art and there were a few paintings I fell in love with but that one stayed my favourite. I kept it to myself for quite a while but eventually I told the guys that I was thinking it could be the artwork.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I hear everything from indie-folk, electronic, even shoegazing being used to describe Daughter&rsquo;s genre. How would you classify Daughter as a band?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a hard time classifying it. I quite like that different words are being turned around, it&rsquo;s not maybe necessarily just like a typical one being used across the board. But for me the way I try to say it is a huge focus on song and on texture and atmosphere. We make sure there&rsquo;s a really interesting world you can delve into with each song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How does Daughter&rsquo;s complex sound translate to live performances and different venues?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think venue space has been important particularly with the first record, but the second one I think that it&rsquo;s a little bit more straightforward in terms of sound so we&rsquo;re actually playing academies which we used to avoid like the plague. Now it feels like in the state that we are with our sound we may be a bit less dependent on a venue. If anything we want something that&rsquo;s a little bit tighter due to the faster rhythm stuff that we&rsquo;re doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You&rsquo;ve been playing a lot of festivals recently &ndash; is there a big difference?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah there is and at the very start we were found playing festivals a bit weird but we&rsquo;ve got our own little space now. We&rsquo;re careful about what places we play but we really love it. There&rsquo;s such an element of surprise, a bit less pressure so it&rsquo;s a lot of fun. And also with the new songs again it&rsquo;s been really fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Daughter hasn&rsquo;t really done any collaborations before &ndash; can you see that happening in the future?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah we&rsquo;d love to do it but I think we&rsquo;re just a bit shy. It&rsquo;s not something where we can necessarily have a natural thing with lots of people getting involved, but it&rsquo;s definitely something we&rsquo;d like to do in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who would be your dream artist to collaborate with?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been a huge admirer of Bjork for a long time. She&rsquo;s been a really big influence to the way I think and play music but there are so many people! I like quite a lot of electronic music too so maybe someone there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What advice would you give to people thinking of starting their own band?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s such an individual thing that I have a hard time giving advice. I think probably the best advice I could give is to make sure to do what feels right to the individuals that are part of the project. You can&rsquo;t let yourself get misguided at any point. At the end of the day it&rsquo;s you that bears the consequences of your actions so you need to be happy and comfortable with what you do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>And finally, what&rsquo;s coming next for Daughter?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s definitely something we need to figure out but I think we need to take a bit of time off first. We&rsquo;ll start thinking about it and collecting individual ideas, so then we can see which way the wind blows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Thank you and looking forward to seeing you play Glasgow!</strong></p>\r\n', 3, 1, '2016-10-31 00:00:00', '2017-07-16 13:33:07', 'interview-with-igor-from-daughter', 1, NULL, 1),
(5, 'Feature: Scotland has decided. But what next?', '', '<div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n<article class=\"rendered-markdown\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\r\n<p>So the answer is &ldquo;No Thanks&rdquo; to an Independent Scotland. And in the end it was a fairly clear No, maybe not as clear as some would have liked but certainly clearer than many expected. Although many of the votes ran pretty close there were only four local government areas out of thirty-two (Glasgow, Dundee, North Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire) where the Yes campaign won and there were plenty of corresponding No areas that won by a clear margin, our own Edinburgh being a fine example. The final result showed a 10% margin in favour of No, a far bigger gap than many of the pollsters were predicting in the days running up to the vote and in the end the final result was known well in advance of the last count (from the tardy Highlands) being announced.<img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/2/content_scotland1.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that&rsquo;s the end of the matter you might think. Oh, how wrong you would be! Whichever way the vote had gone the referendum was always going to send shockwaves through the political life of the British Isles. Already the big names of British politics are buckling down to weather the storm and wisely so, it&rsquo;s going to be no plain sailing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the No vote may have saved the nation from political power plays over the likes of the currency, Trident, the NHS and even the Queen; there are still plenty of issues waiting to rock the boat. First and foremost is the thorny matter of greater devolution in favour of the Scottish Parliament, within the framework of the United Kingdoms. Devo-max, as politics nerds love to call it, would likely increase the scope of the Scottish parliament&rsquo;s authority over tax revenue and housing funds but to exactly what extent has still to be decided, as has the timeframe for the changes. Expect complaints of Westminster stalling from Holyrood and accusations of obstinacy flying the other way as the leaders of the two nations haggle over the extend of Scotland&rsquo;s control over her own spending and taxation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the opposite direction the prospect of Scotland leaving the Union for fresher tides has stirred up discontent in England over the deficiencies of the current political system. Just as in Scotland, many south of the boarder feel alienated from Westminster and disenchanted with its politicians. The Scottish Referendum has shown them that they don&rsquo;t have to except the status quo and many are calling for changes to be made. Particularly contentious has been the so called Midlothian Question. The issue of whether or not Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish MPs should have the right to vote in the House of Commons on issues concerning English Health, Education or Transport when English MPs have no such rights in the Parliaments of the other nations is contentious one. Questions had been raised even before today about the possibility of an English Parliament to match the likes of Holyrood or Stormont and now that the votes are in the calls have not stopped. MPs across England have stated their desire for either the establishment of an English Parliament or the banning of MPs from other nations taking part in votes that exclusively affect England. Either way David Cameron is going to have his hands full calming the demands of MPs, media outlets and voters alike and has already acknowledged that the people of all the nations within the Union must have a bigger say over their own affairs. But let&rsquo;s be honest, in the run up to a General Election it&rsquo;s the last thing he, or his Party, needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another question raised by the events of the Referendum campaign, and one that affects the whole of the UK, is the issue of the voting age. Alex Salmond caused a lot of controversy when he declared two years ago that the voting age for the Referendum would be lowered from the usual 18, to 16. Cue arguments that 16 year olds aren&rsquo;t worldly enough to vote, that they aren&rsquo;t engaged enough in politics to use their vote wisely, that they&rsquo;ll be too easily swayed by the opinions of their parents or their friends, I could go on. But now, in the calm after the storm, many are praising the involvement of Scotland&rsquo;s youth in the debate. Scotland has proved that many young people are interested in politics and that they can engage as fully as their older counterparts in running of their country. So should they be allowed the vote again in future? It&rsquo;s a question many are asking with an eye to next year&rsquo;s general election and it&rsquo;s one that many will be waiting to hear the answer to with bated breath, not least the 16 and 17 year olds who have had their first taste of the democratic system and keen for more. Moreover, with the turnout at the polls averaging at 84% in this vote, levels only dreamed of for General Elections, many are asking how the rest UK can become more engaged in politics and many are pointing to the youth vote as the answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" id=\"main\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/3/content_scotland2.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 464px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So even though Scotland has said No to Independence, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s a No to change. The leaders of all the major Parties have pledge that things will not remain the same in Scotland, or in the rest of the UK, after the ballot boxes, campaign posters and bunting have been cleared away. One thing is for sure, with Alex Salmond stepping down from the leadership of the Scottish government and the SNP, the face of Scottish politics is going to be very different going forward, both metaphorically and literally, as the good ship HMS Scotland sails off into the future.</p>\r\n</article>\r\n</div>\r\n', 4, 1, '2014-09-18 23:00:00', '2017-07-16 13:50:00', 'feature-scotland-has-decided-but-what-next', 2, NULL, 0),

In it Josef K. is arrested in his bedroom by two men on his 30th birthday without being given a reason. For a year he tries to fight the court and proof his innocence. This seems to be impossible as he encounters weird characters on his way who ultimately drive him into complete surrender. Kafka&rsquo;s gloomy story was perfectly displayed in the melancholy stage setting which just like the pale actors and their costumes lacked any colour and presented a dreary, grey atmosphere. While the music and the songs are not worth mentioning as they were rather monotonous, the excellent acting performance rounded up a successful and entertaining production that is definitely worth watching.</p>\r\n', 6, 1, '2017-02-12 00:00:00', '2017-06-28 14:36:22', 'review-the-trial', 3, NULL, NULL),

This doesn&rsquo;t seem to have held him back though, as we are reminded of in Hawking: a biography of the physicist&rsquo;s life, told in his own words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are all aware that Stephen Hawking is an extra-ordinary man, having lived with amyloid lateral sclerosis (ALS) for almost 50 years and concurrently become a world-renowned researcher, teacher and writer; but Hawking takes us further than a list of achievements, and allows us access to Stephen Hawking the child, man, student, friend and husband.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film generally moves chronologically through Hawking&rsquo;s life, with interviews from siblings, colleagues and friends, occasionally moving gently back to the present to show Hawking&rsquo;s day-to-day life at Cambridge and home. Stories from Hawking&rsquo;s childhood move on to give us insight into Hawking&rsquo;s early years at Oxford, when partying, dancing and coxing seemed to take up most of his time; and then onwards to meeting his first wife and the onset of the disease which would change his life forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dramatic effects of ALS are discussed honestly, with Hawking and his family being understandably devastated, however the film is not overly morbid or emotional, much as the human response to harsh life events often isn&rsquo;t. The film is also brave in that it doesn&rsquo;t hero-worship Hawking, there are open accounts from his first wife about the breakdown of their marriage and the difficulty of living with a genius. It is also interesting to hear how much joy Hawking seems to draw from his current celebrity status, clearly proud to be on talk-shows and make cameos in The Simpson&rsquo;s and Star Trek.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All-in-all Hawking is a sincere, truthful and interesting film about a man who is fascinating in so many ways, and ordinary in so many others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Helen saw Hawking as part of Edinburgh International Film Festival 2013</em></p>\r\n', 7, 1, '2013-06-26 23:00:00', '2017-07-16 13:32:46', 'eiff-review-hawking', 3, NULL, 1),

It swings wildly from one topic to another; one minute, the voice of Bernie Sanders is sputtering out his hunched figure, the next, he off-handedly veers into a pitch for a filthy Netflix show. The hour is more a loose series of vignettes than a finely honed, thematically focused piece, and the show feels a little disconnected at times. This approach more than fits Adomian&rsquo;s conversational, scatter-brained style, which is pretty damn charming.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">While there isn&rsquo;t a message or lesson to mull over afterwards as in other stand-up shows, Adomian gives you unrestrained comedic talent.

If you want to watch someone switch topics from Wii and weight anxiety to Stalin and marijuana, go see this show.

Martin&rsquo;s new show is definitely carried by her distinctive voice, fizzing with energy yet uncertain, enthusiastic to get to the point, yet not sure where that point is. Her bittersweet show is peppered with absurd asides, and although this can make the show feel almost flippant, Martin still manages to drive the emotional impact home. On top of this balancing act, she doesn&rsquo;t sacrifice the high-energy mood that she usually brings to her shows; impressive considering the show is about her struggle with addiction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martin&rsquo;s show ends with a narrative ambiguity that is oddly fitting for the arc of the show, and her finish is one of the most memorable I&rsquo;ve seen in ages. Her scattergun energy gave her routines a force that is hard to find elsewhere. A freewheeling hour is brought to a close with a routine that ratchets up faster than I could register, and despite some loose ends, the ending feels oddly satisfying. Martin&rsquo;s show would be a great choice for anyone looking for mile-a-minute narrative stand-up, or perhaps something with a more optimistic outlook.</p>\r\n', 11, 1, '2017-08-09 16:10:53', '2017-08-10 14:14:08', 'review-mae-martin-dope', 5, NULL, 0),

He moves from impassioned rants to slow, difficult silence suddenly, and then will turn to you with a knowing look in his eye. This is what makes it all work; little acknowledgements of humility that bring Shah&rsquo;s audience round to him. Shah could very much be an unlikeable figure, and he could have been, in another life, a more aggressive, adversarial comic. In this show, Shah uses these moments of vulnerability to help deliver a surprisingly powerful show on Brexit and the rise of the far-right in the UK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shah focuses his show around the role of history in the political life of the UK, and in his personal life. T the role of the British Empire in the story of his family takes a central position in the show, ridiculing the ignorance that many British people have about this part of their history.

The start of the show goes as absurdly as you would expect from the title and the poster; Falafel goes on stage playing a Toilet Duck as a saxophone, &ldquo;performing&rdquo; a deliberately awful version of Gerry Rafferty&rsquo;s Baker Street. The show has great bursts of creativity throughout it, and I&#39;m a sucker for absurdist comedy, so I love it. It&#39;s a show that weaves in and out of genres, whether it&rsquo;s prop comedy, musical comedy, or stand-up. After 20 minutes, it unfortunately became clear that much of Falafel&rsquo;s act is relatively standard observational comedy, which doesn&#39;t sit well with the rest of his act.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\">Falafel&rsquo;s style does distinguish itself when he is doing observersational material, however. The first half-hour is an interwoven series of callbacks to set-ups that had been dropped minutes before. Non-sequiturs are shown to have been set-ups to punch-lines delivered 10 minutes later. Although some of his jokes seem like they could have been part of Tommy Cooper&#39;s act, this retro feel seems strangely fitting for Olaf Falafel. However, some of his jokes do seem like they were written to be absurd, rather than funny.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\">However, Falafel&rsquo;s actual content is sadly a little lack-lustre, and the topics themselves are somewhat well-trodden. For a comedian with such an off-beat style, his content does seem too pedestrian for him. The show itself did seem to be lacking more absurdity as it went on. The climax of the show is also a nice payoff, but the impact is lessened considerably by the overlong preparation for it. This is a problem that much of Falafel&#39;s material suffers from, and I would like to see less time wasted between the set up and the punchline.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\">Falafel still shows signs of real promise. His prop comedy, crowd-work, and use of multimedia add a lot to the show, and there is a lot of charm to his more old-fashioned jokes. I hope we see more of him in the future, and that he gets a lot stranger.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n', 11, 1, '2017-08-14 15:48:26', '2017-08-19 21:39:06', 'review-olaf-falafel-marmosets-of-my-mind', 5, NULL, 0),

The songs themselves are performed with style and pleasant to listen to, but some could have used more gags. The show feels a little aimless at times, although this may be due to Braine&rsquo;s character being aimless, not Braine herself.

The spell is addressed to Mercury, the Roman god of poetry, luck, and a divine guide for souls. O&rsquo;Neill, after his appearance, explains that the spell was not entirely an act, and that he has performed it previously in a genuine ritual. All I can say is that if he wanted to improve his performance skills and give himself guidance, it&rsquo;s worked. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\">O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s performance style is confrontational, loud, and brutally funny. &ldquo;Brutally funny&rdquo; because there isn&rsquo;t a better way I can phrase it. He is funny at you, not to you. You&rsquo;re not entirely sure what&rsquo;s happening, you don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re laughing this much, and you&rsquo;re not entirely sure why he&rsquo;s yelling. O&rsquo;Neill commands your attention with wide-eyed mania, yelling out non-sequiturs that are later brought into the fold of a joke. He performs with a manner reminiscent of the metal bands whose names run down his jeans.

Donnelly&rsquo;s laid-back conversational style is gentle and unassuming, and the venue definitely helps build the feeling he seems to be aiming for. The small confines lend themselves to Donnelly&rsquo;s moderate tones, drawing you into a show that is more about the internal world than the external.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\">For a show about hallucinogens and the mystical, Donnelly&rsquo;s style is suitably dream-like and measured. You&rsquo;re never quite sure if you should be expecting a punchline or tender moment. The show swings from emotional truths to the profane and scatological in a beat, keeping you a little off balance, despite Donnelly&rsquo;s affability. His occasional musings on his mental state are endearing, and emotionally resonant. However, there are still &nbsp;echoes of his previous, man-down-the-pub style to him.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\">Donnelly&rsquo;s brought his stand-up skills to bear on stories that have real heart to them. He deals with genuinely difficult topics with humour. He also avoids being flippant with these topics, which would be difficult task for anyone. Donnelly has definitely brought one of the more unassumingly powerful shows on the fringe this year.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n', 11, 1, '2017-08-17 19:07:15', '2017-08-18 21:04:46', 'review-carl-donnelly-nutter-on-the-bus', 5, NULL, 0),

Roberts speaks for much of the show in a cod-chaucerian dialect, which he prods the audience into adopting. He arrives on stage loosely wrapped in a towel, a flower poking out of his backside. The show is based on the premise that John-Luke Roberts is actually Chaucer, awoken after a Tir Nan nOg-like slumber, because John-Luke Roberts wants the show to be &ldquo;significant&rdquo;. The show sadly rarely deals with this premise, but doesn&rsquo;t waste time, catapulting itself from one absurd premise to the next. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\">Roberts rarely lets an opportunity pass by him, even turning costume changes into a joke. Audience members are asked to cover him up with a towel, which shrinks as the show continues. The technician is roped in to awkwardly provide a voiceover while Roberts is performing a major costume change backstage. This all makes the show seem like a continual parade of absurdity, which feels exciting, rather than overwhelming. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\">John-Luke Roberts&rsquo; show is an absurd hour filled with fantastic ideas, perfect for fans of The Goons, Big Train, or The Mighty Boosh.

Auton uses verse with restrain, but these passing moments show a rare sense for sentiment and rhythm, the verse tripping off his tongue extremely naturally. Auton begins unassumingly, or at least as unassumingly as a man in a hair-covered suit can. He gradually draws the audience into his inner world, pulling them in with his charming dramatic voice and endearingly awkward movement on stage. The show is unusual, yet comforting.

Marcus&#39; wit is impeccable, and his ability to think on his feet adds to the brilliant humour of the show. Audience interaction is a predominant feature that adds to the impulsive and riotous nature of the show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filled with a ton of laughs and even a surprise appearance from the King of Rock and Roll himself, Marcus demonstrates his versatility and talent as an accomplished performer and comedian.

Just over a year ago, he finally signed to a major label, Island Records. He released his mixtape, <em>Sixteen</em>, in June to celebrate this shift in his career. Last week Rebecca Somer and Robbie James got to chat with him backstage at the O2 Academy Glasgow about his new project and growth as an artist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Robbie James: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re supporting Dizzee Rascal on his Raskit Tour, which started last night in Liverpool. I had a few friends at the concert, so I saw it on Snapchat. It looked mad! How was the first night of the tour?&rdquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Donae&rsquo;O: &ldquo;It was tremendous. It was a good start. I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect. I had never really done concerts before. I&rsquo;ve only done one, which was mine. Never really been on tour, and Dizzee Rascal, he&rsquo;s one of, if not the, biggest in our scene. Sometimes you feel there&rsquo;s a bit of pressure, but yeah, it was cool.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Rebecca Somer: &ldquo;How did <em>Sixteen</em> come about?&rdquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Donae&rsquo;O: &ldquo;I signed to Island [Records] in December, put out &#39;Black&#39; and &#39;Black&#39; did well. I was like, &lsquo;We need to put out a project now.&rsquo; They were like &lsquo;No, we think you need to build the buzz&rsquo;, and I was like &lsquo;Ok, cool, let me just make a mixtape, and put it out, so I thought let me just do <em>Sixteen</em>.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a new experience. They let me hire out a studio, which I&rsquo;m not really used to doing. I&rsquo;m used to recording in my mum&rsquo;s house, in my bedroom in the corner. I thought &lsquo;let me just try something new&rsquo;, so I made it in three months. Usually, I make my albums in a year or year and a half. This was compressed, but it was a good experience. Now, I&rsquo;m ready. I can see now that when you&rsquo;re making records, sometimes you have to be in the moment, and that&rsquo;s what <em>Sixteen</em> taught me- that I can be in the moment and that I can make a project there and then.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2yHiJQBtWhFCcMbIsTKLSh\" width=\"700\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Robbie: &ldquo;I&#39;ve always wondered to what extent the songwriting process is a case of saying &#39;Right, this evening I&#39;m gonna go write a song&#39;, versus a more natural process that comes about while travelling?&rdquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Donae&rsquo;O: &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a bit of both. I think you should be proactive in trying and then sometimes it may not come up unless you&rsquo;ve tried. Sometimes when you have a hit, you need to just go and make the album. You need to constantly feed your fans. You know what I&rsquo;m saying?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Rebecca: &ldquo;What was your favourite track on <em>Sixteen</em>?&rdquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Donae&rsquo;O: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really do the whole favourite track thing. All of my songs I like equally. That is why I&rsquo;ve never ever had a favourite record. The only thing I will say is my favourite to do is when I&rsquo;m performing, I like performing &lsquo;Move to Da Gyal Dem&rsquo; most because people respond to that the most. People dance to it the most. It&rsquo;s just a fun track to put on.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Rebecca: &ldquo;How do you hope for people to respond to your music?&rdquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Donae&rsquo;O: &ldquo;I hope they enjoy it really. That&rsquo;s it. I hope they enjoy it as much as I enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Rebecca: &ldquo;Can you talk a little about how you&rsquo;ve evolved as a musician from your early days when you dropped your first singles &lsquo;Falling&rsquo; &amp; &lsquo;My Philosophy (Bounce)&rsquo; to today?&rdquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Donae&rsquo;O: &ldquo;I think when I was coming in I didn&rsquo;t really know what I was doing. And now, I know a bit more. I still don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing, but I know a bit more than I did then. I know that I will always make my way through. I remember how I was feeling back then. When you put out your first record, you don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re ever going to do it again. Whereas now I don&rsquo;t feel like that. I always feel like I&rsquo;ll eventually make something, so I have way more confidence in my abilities than I did then.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Rebecca: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the greatest lesson you&rsquo;ve learned from being in the industry for so long?&rdquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Donae&rsquo;O: &ldquo;Always be able to stand on your own two. You&rsquo;re always going to need help, but it&rsquo;s better to be an individual than a team, meaning you should be confident in your own skills because when you join a team, it&rsquo;s your skills that you bring to the table, and you need to find a team that respects that and don&rsquo;t want you to be everyone else. You have to find your own way.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Robbie: &ldquo;I read an interview of you in TRENCH recently, and it asked you to describe your career and journey through music with one word. You said &lsquo;independence.&rsquo; Where does that independence and self-sufficiency stem from?&rdquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Donae&rsquo;O: &ldquo;That was a necessity when I started because we didn&rsquo;t have platforms, and I wanted to make music, so I had to work it out for myself. I had a massive need and passion to make music and no platform to express that passion, so I had to create my own platform.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Rebecca: &ldquo;What music or artists inspire you right now?&rdquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Donae&rsquo;O: &ldquo;Lotto Boyzz, Kojo Funds, J Hus, Skepta, Don-E. I&rsquo;m listening to a lot of Afro-wave. That&rsquo;s what they call it now.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Rebecca: &ldquo;What should we look forward to in your upcoming studio album?&rdquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Donae&rsquo;O: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet.

How&rsquo;s the reaction been for that? Have you been excited?&rdquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Donae&rsquo;O: &ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s been really good to be honest.

I think it&rsquo;s amazing how he created a T.V. series on Youtube off of these five characters, and Shaq was one of them, and like Shaq&rsquo;s journey from being a criminal to going the righteous path. Again, 1Xtra supported him in that journey because he&rsquo;s an actor, a comedy actor, but they supported it, and it&rsquo;s helped him get that deal. I think people should look at how he created his own way and created something that was entertaining. He went all the way with it and done it to the best of his ability. The fact that &#39;Man&rsquo;s Not Hot&#39; is charting. I hope he takes it into movies, and he&rsquo;s talented in that way.

Sit down. How&rsquo;s things?&rsquo; And so it begins. A dark, absurdist and brutal comedy that descends into a disturbingly realistic prophecy of a corporate life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emma, an employee at a big multinational, is bound to a contract whereby she must not leave any aspect of her private life undeclared in order to keep her job. This could be an ideal foundation for humour. The disparity over what Emma and Darren, her love interest, define as &lsquo;romantic&rsquo; is amusing, and the audience settles nicely into the comedy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But for the boss, the presence of a candle at the employee&rsquo;s &lsquo;romantic&rsquo; dinner is a matter of protocol, and needs to be resolved. The relentless probing has begun. The professional-personal boundary is obliterated. The boss tries an awkward human gesture, professing occasionally, &lsquo;oh, just small talk&rsquo;, but really, Emma&rsquo;s every utterance is being detailed and filed. The veneer of interest and care barely masks the obsessive and inhumane quest for answers; the term &lsquo;care&rsquo; is only familiar to her because of the company&rsquo;s &lsquo;duty of care&rsquo; pamphlet that she can produce at a flourish at any sign of emotion on Emma&rsquo;s part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The set design of the simplistic office reflects the corporate environment. The nameless boss is on stage as the audience enters the auditorium, and does not leave until we do, fitting for a character with an obsessive commitment to her job and lack of a more human existence outside of the workplace. Even between scene changes, she doesn&rsquo;t leave her office den of manipulation and heartlessness, continuing to pace and do paperwork as a blue sterile light floods the stage. Perhaps the fact that the clock wasn&rsquo;t working was not intended, but it did serve to emphasise the obsessive, repetitive questions and heighten the intensity of the play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus the play swerves from comedy to sinister realism and it makes for uncomfortable viewing, which Mark Bartlett, author of the play, has mastered elsewhere, in his BBC drama, Doctor Foster. We&rsquo;re forced to keep watching, just as Emma is repeatedly summoned to the office, but we&rsquo;re begging for some kind of d&eacute;nouement, to put an end to this tortuous episode. But there&rsquo;s more, and as Emma brings a shoe box supposedly containing her dead son onto the stage, the audience is paralysed between laugher and distress in the climax to this piece of dark absurdist theatre.

(25, 'Tim Hecker at Summerhall', 'The nuance of Tim Hecker\'s ambient music did not translate well in his performance at Summerhall.', '<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/24/content_Tim-Hecker-by-Emily-Berl-3.jpg\" style=\"width: 632px; height: 608px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Canadian ambient producer Tim Hecker has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/06/tim-hecker-review-st-john-at-hackney-london\">criticised in the past</a> for the lack of spectacle in his live shows and if fans anticipated a change of approach for his run of concerts this year- perhaps this time offering more visual appeal- &nbsp;last Wednesday&rsquo;s performance surely came as a disappointment. The decision to perform completely in darkness should ideally allow the artist&rsquo;s ego to retreat and the music to take over- but this artistic decision came across as arrogant and a cheap way of appearing profound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Set in Summerhall&rsquo;s Dissection Room, Edinburgh&rsquo;s own dark ambient duo Super Inuit begin the evening. Their gravelly low bass is punctuated by beams of synth, samples of spoken-word and Fern Morris&rsquo; relaxed vocals (her voice occasionally reminiscent of Portishead&rsquo;s Beth Gibbons&rsquo;) &nbsp;which allows the audience to ease into the show. Ambient music is by no means easy-listening, and so Super Inuit serve as a suitable median between the uncomplicated music of everyday life and Tim Hecker&rsquo;s experimental synth-driven fuzz which we are soon to experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As Hecker arrives onstage, the Dissection Room is plunged into near-total darkness- illuminated only by the blue emergency-exit sign. It remains this way for the rest of his 50 minute set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Armed to the teeth with synths and drum pads, Hecker doesn&rsquo;t play anything that is recognisably his. Since it has been well over a year following the release of his last album Love Streams, it would make sense if he has chosen to show us samples of some new projects. Even if this is the case, it appears as if he is making it up as he goes along. Rolling waves of feedback give way to dense droning bass which resonates in the floor and walls. Wailing peals of synth are interspersed with sporadic gargling sounds and long, drawn out thuds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One could argue that ambient music is equally about what you don&rsquo;t play as what you do- ambience is often formed from the absence of sound itself- and therefore, one might suggest that the decision to perform in a dark space could only serve to amplify the intricacies of the music. By removing the audience&rsquo;s reliance on seeing in order to be entertained, Hecker forces them to focus on his experimental ambient and drone music that engulfs the room. This vision-depravation however also allows the audience to focus on the uncomfortable feeling of standing for a prolonged period of time and the familiar glow of phone screens indicate that after a while, some become restless. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tim Hecker has said that he enjoys <a href=\"http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/tim-hecker-virgins\">&ldquo;inhabiting the tropes of religious music without that promise of angels at the end&rdquo;</a> and fans have in the past compared attending his performances to having a religious or spiritual experience. Hecker&rsquo;s performance did indeed remind me of being in church as a child- but not for the grandeur of the music. Instead I listened, wondering for how long I would be required to stand while internally hoping it would be over soon. I would hardly call that a religious experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 17, 1, '2017-10-10 20:31:11', '2017-10-10 20:33:07', 'tim-hecker-at-summerhall', 1, NULL, 1),

After a short period of applause, the musicians immediately started playing on their three guitars while James Yorkston sang the tune. This first song set up an important expectation for the audience: this gig was not about any one of them. All three were on stage the entire time, alternating playing each other&rsquo;s songs. Using this strategy, Yorkston, Drever, and Wilson created an intimate and engaging show that felt like you were listening in on a jam session between three old friends. The most effective of the songs they played were those sung and performed by all three, replicating a traditional experience of folk music. It felt as if they were playing folk music the way it was meant to be played: informally, communally, and with a good sense of humor. Some of the sincerest and most genuine moments in the show were when they joked to each other about their kids and broke into laughter mid-song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only downfall of their casual performance was that is was occasionally unpracticed to a fault. On one hand, if the show felt too polished, it would not have suited the acoustic music all three of the musicians play. However, they spent a few of the songs laughing throughout about mistakes being made on the guitar or on the mandolin. Although this did take away somewhat from the performance, the overall effect of watching the three talented and experienced musicians jam with each other for a couple of hours was one of familiarity, openness, and warmth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 136, 1, '2017-10-10 21:04:18', '2017-10-10 21:10:12', 'james-yorkston-kris-drever-and-dan-wilson-at-summerhall', 1, NULL, 0),

Trying to draw a crowd for the gig was a difficult feat with Scotland playing a crucial World Cup qualifier on the same night. However, by the end of the show there was indeed a healthy wee gathering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first act of the night is a young solo artist named Nate Collins. Based in Edinburgh he has been working on several releases and his Soundcloud shows promise. His two latest releases &#39;Honey&rsquo; and &lsquo;Otherwise&rsquo; show song writing variety but it seems that during this performance the odds have been stacked against him. With several technical difficulties and slightly unfortunate out of time looping causing problems, he finishes the set with an abrupt ending to a Two Door Cinema Club cover. Although a slightly painful end to his set, I would definitely give him another chance as the talent and promise is quite obviously present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly afterwards, the Opera Comic, a Leeds based, Noel Fielding look-alike band take the stage. Starting the set with a strange Willy Wonka cover they continue with what can only be described as pure and persistent indie. Their first single &lsquo;We Are the Freaks&rsquo; has that treble guitar sound so emblematic of the genre as well as the &lsquo;no one understands me&rsquo; message typical of indie anthems. Although slightly clich&eacute; it is definitely a well put-together and skilfully performed song. Their newest release &lsquo;A Time of Hope&rsquo; has more depth; ironically disregarding the lack of hope in the world at the moment. The performance is slick and they have full-on stage presence but it seems as if they offer nothing new or different. It will be interesting to see how they develop as a group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now come the headliners of the night: Dancing on Tables are a band on the rise. Firmly established in the young Scottish alternative/indie scene they have been pleasing crowds with their soft, romantic songs all summer. Having played festivals all over the country including Kendal Calling and Solas, their set is a lot more organised and rehearsed than when I saw them last. The interesting use of two vocalists creates a dialogue in their music which is evident in the banter they have on stage. It is obvious that they are simply happy to be playing good music with their friends; and it&#39;s incredibly endearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their debut EP <em>Don&rsquo;t Stop</em> features fuzzy guitar driven sound punctuated by intricate melody. For a four-track record, the variety in sound is amazing. The slight fuzz which permeates each track, works in their favour and shows the band&#39;s simple but lovely core. Their newest release &lsquo;Tracey&rsquo; in contrast, is clean cut and one for the dance floor and it goes down a treat during the show. A fantastic band full of promise, they will be releasing some new music at the start of November and I for one am excited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 94, 1, '2017-10-12 20:03:38', '2017-10-12 20:09:56', 'nate-collins-the-opera-comic-and-dancing-on-tables-at-sneaky-petes', 1, NULL, 1),

Think of Sam Smith (first hitting the charts with Disclosure on Latch), John Newman (similarly with Sigala on Feel the Love) and Anne-Marie (who appeared on four tracks on Rudimental&rsquo;s 2015 album We The Generation) to name just a few. Having appeared on Chase and Status&rsquo; 2016 single &lsquo;All Goes Wrong&rsquo;, it appears that Tom Grennan will soon be following this newly established route into the music mainstream. As any audience member at Tom Grennan&rsquo;s sold out show in Glasgow on the 7<sup>th</sup> October will tell you, for the Bedford born singer-songwriter it can&rsquo;t come soon enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite visibly struggling after being &ldquo;ill as a dog&rdquo; following a lengthy UK tour schedule, Grennan captivates the packed crowd of St Luke&rsquo;s Church this Saturday night with his unique vocals, charismatic stage presence and visible excitement for his own music. Kicking off the show with his latest single &lsquo;Royal Highness&rsquo; Tom clearly has the crowd on his side from the start. As the set continues, his sense of connection with the audience only increases as his honest, self-deprecating style comes to the fore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tempo of the set is controlled and varies impressively: from the up-beat festival-ready anthems (such as &lsquo;Lighting Matches&rsquo; and &lsquo;Giving It All&rsquo;) to the incredibly honest bluesy Jamie-T style crowd favourite &lsquo;Old Songs&rsquo;. The audience participates with him in change of pace throughout the performance. Whilst his stripped-back acoustic rendition of &lsquo;Sweet Hallelujah&rsquo; leaves the packed auditorium in an uncharacteristic quiet, his stunning vocals cause few to doubt Grennan&rsquo;s musical pedigree. The quiet doesn&rsquo;t last for long however. Typical of the entire set; Grennan&rsquo;s on stage energy instantly lifts the crowd for his hit &lsquo;Found What I&rsquo;ve Been Looking For&rsquo;. With the instantly recognisable introduction, from what is currently his most streamed single on Spotify (no doubt fuelled by its recent inclusion in the FIFA &rsquo;18 video game and as the theme music for Sky Sports&rsquo; Premier League Football coverage), the anthem is belted out by a packed audience</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While &lsquo;Found What I&rsquo;ve Been Looking For&rsquo; might be the most popular single of the evening, what is most impressive is&nbsp;Grennan&rsquo;s enthusiasm and confidence on stage while remaining incredibly honest and self-deprecating. More established performers may shy away from this, trying to create and maintain a public image. However, Grennan&rsquo;s unfiltered language, unique voice, quirky observations and admissions throughout the set (such as his confession that he was wearing a stinking shirt) mean that he really does stand out in the crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the old shirt, in the packed St Luke&rsquo;s Hall, the only lingering smell was one of a young man, full of ambition and just months away from smashing into the mainstream.

This tour we&rsquo;re heading back to a lot of places that I&rsquo;ve either have done not that recently, or did years ago. I&rsquo;m heading back to a lot of places that I haven&rsquo;t been back to for a while.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>I&rsquo;m super excited to see that you&rsquo;re playing in Findhorn, which is a tiny coastal village not far where I&rsquo;m from in the North of Scotland! What is it that&rsquo;s driven you to play some of the more remote parts of the UK this time around?</b><br />\r\nI think they&rsquo;re generally better gigs! I&rsquo;ve played so many of the larger places so many times, it&rsquo;s nice to explore a bit more. There&rsquo;s always a great vibe to a big city gig, but I think you get a deeper connection with the crowd in the smaller venues.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>I definitely agree with you on that one. Do you find that you get a bit more of a variation in the type of people that come to your gigs these days?&nbsp;</b><br />\r\nI don&rsquo;t think there could be any more variation in the crowds that come to my gigs! It&rsquo;s honestly the most diverse group of people that I&rsquo;ve ever come across. I recently had three generations of a family stay behind for a photo after a gig. The other thing that I hear quite a lot is that my music is often passed around families; I hear that kids have introduced their parents to it or vice versa and then everyone ends up coming to the gig. It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Your new album, <em>Hit the Ground Running</em> came out on 1st September 2017, which is 10 years since your first album was released. What&rsquo;s changed for you personally in that time, or in terms of your musical style?&nbsp;</b><br />\r\nWell, I just dropped my six-year-old son off at school, if that answers your question! But also, musically&hellip; well, the whole game&rsquo;s changed. The first album was big on MySpace. People were still talking about Bebo! And now it&rsquo;s obviously completely different. The way that the charts work is different, the way that people experience music has changed. And that&rsquo;s global. I&rsquo;ve never had more people ask me about vinyl than on the last European tour.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Do you always release your material on vinyl in addition to the digital copies?</b><br />\r\nYeah. The latest record is independent, it&rsquo;s my own label. So I was definitely doing vinyl for this one! But when other people are in charge, they sometimes say &ldquo;Oh, we really don&rsquo;t need to do vinyl&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;m just like, &ldquo;Come on, man!&rdquo; But for this one we&rsquo;ve had some really good vinyl copies. In fact, I signed 500 of them over the last few days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Are there any particular gigs over the last ten years that have really stood out for you? Where&rsquo;s your favourite place to play?</b><br />\r\nI&rsquo;m just trying to think&hellip; I just really love playing, and I really don&rsquo;t care where. I almost don&rsquo;t even care to how many people! I&rsquo;ve had great gigs in tiny venues in other countries, countries I&rsquo;ve never been to before - places where I&rsquo;m just starting out - &nbsp;and there&rsquo;s a completely different vibe to that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>From your most recent album, who would you say that your greatest musical influences have been?&nbsp;</b><br />\r\nFor this one, it was much more soul influenced. Vocally, I was listening to stuff like Donny Hathaway and Chris Stapleton, quite serious vocalists, which is slightly different to usual because I&rsquo;m usually more of a guitar-nerd than a vocal-nerd. But then I think over the last few years I&rsquo;ve developed my voice a huge amount, partly through lessons and partly through really exploring it and pushing it on my own. I&rsquo;ve basically gained an octave and a half of range to play with. Most of this record I couldn&rsquo;t have sung a few years ago, like &lsquo;Hit the Ground&rsquo; - there&rsquo;s no way I could have got up there! And now the album lends itself to being played live so much more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>I&rsquo;m a big fan of your cover of &lsquo;Get Free&rsquo; by Major Lazer from the <em>Human Love</em> album. Do you have any other songs that you&rsquo;d like to cover in the future?&nbsp;</b><br />\r\nI think covers should be outside of your comfort zone, there&rsquo;s no point in covering something that you could have written anyway. Actually&hellip; I&rsquo;m not quite sure how this happened, but there was a certain character that at a gig of mine once, kind of Kenneth Williams-esque&hellip; for some reason he started rapping, and I started doing a bit of &lsquo;Ante Up&rsquo; by M.O.P, in the style of Kenneth Williams&hellip; it was completely random, but I kind of like that when an artist goes slightly off piste when they&rsquo;re live. Everyone knows you&rsquo;re just making it up as you go along, and as soon as they realise that, everyone&rsquo;s more engaged and more interested.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>You&rsquo;ve been pretty big on the festival circuit in recent years. Do you have any big ones that you like to play in particular?</b><br />\r\nGlastonbury will always be special to me, that was one of the first big festivals that I did. I actually played Bohemian Rhapsody in my pants one year&hellip; a weird way to spend an afternoon! A cold, cold experience. But gigwise, when it&rsquo;s just you on your own, you can react to anything, and every night I&rsquo;ve been playing songs that I didn&rsquo;t think I was going to play. It&rsquo;s a different level of freedom, it&rsquo;s so much fun. I do a huge amount of crowd participation. What I&rsquo;ve started doing recently is getting the crowd to do two different parts, then I do a part that harmonizes with half of one and the other half of the other, and every night I&rsquo;m astonished by what I hear coming back and how it sounds as a whole. It&rsquo;s just a really beautiful thing, it&rsquo;s a form of communication. I&rsquo;m very much from the school of thinking that I&rsquo;m there on stage to do whatever the crowd wants me to do, as opposed to the idea of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna play and you&rsquo;re gonna listen&rdquo;. So if the crowd talks, that&rsquo;s my fault.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Amazing! Okay, one final qu</b><strong>estion from me.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to go a bit Desert Island Discs... If you were stranded on a desert island, what is your one luxury item that you&rsquo;d take with you, one book and one singular record?</strong><br />\r\nOkay&hellip; I think my luxury item would definitely have to be a guitar. As long as there&rsquo;s some coconuts on the island that I can use for percussion. Book-wise&hellip; I think I&rsquo;d take Jonathon Livingston&rsquo;s Seagull. I read that book once, if not twice, every year anyway. It&rsquo;s a beautiful book. Very short and easy to read but really beautiful - it reaffirms everything that you already know but which just occasionally might need reconfirming.

The sound of his limbs hitting the stage breaks the auditorium&rsquo;s silence. The audience is tense, and even as Blanche is christened with an extravagant feather headpiece laughs are withheld. The uncommon sight of a visibly disabled actor commanding the stage leads to clenched jaws and held breath, and proves exactly why this play has been created and should be seen. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Body\" style=\"border:none; margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">&nbsp; Set in the dressing room of a disabled, drag production of &lsquo;Whatever Happened to Baby Jane&rsquo;, the play&rsquo;s narrative develops through squabbles, proclamations about identity and shared moments of glory &ndash; including an Abba number. Though the premise &ndash; breaking the fourth wall to reveal backstage antics &ndash; is nothing new, the show&rsquo;s breaking down of social taboos should be commended.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Body\" style=\"border:none; margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; The tension backstage builds to a breaking point when Bette forces Blanche to prove she cannot walk.

Drawn out, and with a foregone conclusion, instead of being gripped by the drama it left me waiting for it to reach the conclusion. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Body\" style=\"border:none; margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">&nbsp; T</span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">he laughter is hesitant to begin with. However, as the show progresses, the audience begins to relax, and to realise that yes, the show is funny; and yes, these &lsquo;actually disabled&rsquo; actors are indeed capable of delivering unflinching jokes about &lsquo;spaz-fucks&rsquo; and facials. The atmosphere in the auditorium swells towards a triumphant and hearty applause at the plays conclusion.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Body\" style=\"border:none; margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">When the play isn&rsquo;t telling our prejudiced concept of disability to &lsquo;F*** Off&rsquo; (the concluding statement from Robert&rsquo;s searing monologue), it encourages the audience to engage in reflection &ndash; sometimes quite literally.

Garry Robson&rsquo;s Butch delivers touching thoughts on his role as a father, and Kinny Gardner&rsquo;s Bette laments the passage of time.

Propelled by the success of his brilliant and upbeat new album&nbsp;<em>Wake Up Now</em>, Mulvey treats his audience to an entertaining and moving set which boasts several new tracks, as well as favourites from his debut&nbsp;<em>First Mind</em>&nbsp; which has already established him as a popular artist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The talented London-based songwriter has a huge grin on his face when - midway through the show - the adoring crowd belt out the words to &lsquo;Cucurucu&rsquo; with him. The intimacy of the night is again evident when&nbsp;Mulvey&nbsp;hears a drunken yell from an excited fan requesting him to play country classic &lsquo;Look At Miss Ohio&rsquo;. After laughing &quot;Miss Ohio?&quot; in response, he performs what is a simultaneously joyful and funny cover of the song, which is evident from the equally smiley audience.&nbsp;Mulvey&nbsp;is humble and doesn&#39;t seem to be taking himself too seriously, which makes him all the more likeable and causes the fans to really connect with him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before performing his new track &lsquo;Myela&rsquo;, written about the refugee crisis,&nbsp;Mulvey&nbsp;speaks of a need for big changes in the world. He says that refugees fleeing to Europe aren&#39;t just an issue we need to resolve but &quot;a message&quot; that we, as a society, need to hear. He claims the same is true for global warming, and that the hurricanes and earthquakes are also &quot;a message&quot; from the world that we need to make significant changes. A bucket for donations toward the refugee crisis is then passed around and filled with spare change. Although this slightly dampens the cheery mood of the crowd, it is a moving gesture that gives&nbsp;Mulvey&rsquo;s&nbsp;songs deeper meaning which is so often lacking in today&rsquo;s charts. The buzz of the crowd quickly returns when the singer and his band produce a special performance of &#39;Myela&#39;, before playing arguably his most&nbsp;recognisable&nbsp;hit &lsquo;Fever To The Form&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After walking off stage briefly,&nbsp;Mulvey&nbsp;returns to the delight of the audience to close the night with two fun and upbeat songs off his new album, &lsquo;Transform Your Game&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mountain To Move&rsquo;. A large section of the crowd begins dancing and it is a positive finish to a successful and accomplished show.&nbsp;Mulvey&nbsp;makes a couple of noticeable mistakes in his guitar-playing, but these are certainly forgiven by his fans who are definitely not disappointed. Let&rsquo;s hope Nick keeps his promise to return to Edinburgh &quot;very soon&quot;!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 139, 1, '2017-10-19 23:41:01', '2017-10-21 21:32:39', 'nick-mulvey-at-liquid-room-edinburgh', 1, NULL, 1),

(37, 'Corella at Voodoo Rooms', '', '<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/44/content_corella-band.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 533px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mood before Corella&rsquo;s set on Saturday is ambivalent at best. They are performing in the middle of a 3-band lineup; a Manchester band placed in-between two local bands both with large followings here in Edinburgh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This skepticism from the crowd is emphasized by the fact that first band, Betty and the Bass, a small bluesy rock outfit, have just lit up the Voodoo Rooms. Corella starts playing to the small crowd- most of which are standing near the back. One might expect them to respond negatively to this initial lack of enthusiasm, especially after sold-out gigs throughout England, but they are surprisingly upbeat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Live, the band&rsquo;s pop-influenced indie-rock music becomes more rowdy and guitar-focused, letting the musical talent of the band members stand out. They energetically explore the instrumental parts of their songs, and their funky guitars and wild drumming make even the most cynical audience members want to dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recordings, the vocals and pop melodies is what makes Corella&rsquo;s songs stand out, and this holds true during their live show as well. A good example of their balance between energy and skillful songwriting is in their performance of &lsquo;Waterfall&rsquo;, their first single. The lyrics and the accompanying vocals are bubbly and uplifting, and the song performed by a different band could easily be made into a pop hit. Instead, Corella bring the guitar solo towards the end of the song into the forefront, letting the band&rsquo;s gritty rock influences shine through. The lead singer, Joel, sings the lyrics with such intense passion and energy that it brings even more depth to the song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What stands out more than the dynamic performance is that the band are engaging, kind, and most significantly, humble. At least three times towards the end of the set, Joel encourages the crowd to come talk to them about their music in the bar next door to the performance space. Many times more, he thanks the audience for being there and listening to their music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to note that Corella has every reason to be cocky. Their most recent single, &lsquo;Barcelona Girl&rsquo;, has been featured on Spotify&rsquo;s &ldquo;Indie Roadtrip&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Indie List&rdquo; playlists and has over 300,000 plays on Spotify as of the writing of this review. They have achieved this without a full EP or even graduating from university, and somehow, in front of a small and unfamiliar audience, they put on an infectious live show. It will be exciting to see what they do next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 136, 1, '2017-10-25 18:12:06', '2017-10-26 09:28:35', 'corella-at-voodoo-rooms', 1, NULL, 1),

He has it all: his quick wit, intellectual superiority and theatrical success means men want to be him, while his charm and charisma make women want to be with him. In short, he is almost insufferable. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">&#39;The Real Thing&#39;&nbsp;is simultaneously a sly dig at conceited literati, and a love letter to the powers of a clever reply or a passionate monologue. However, in this touring version,&nbsp;stylishly directed by Stephen Unwin, any emotional punches fall short. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Perhaps the 1982 script just hasn&rsquo;t aged well &ndash; the political struggles that Henry so eloquently criticises is perfectly legitimised and praised in 2017. Increased awareness of intersectionality and inherent privilege mean that to a contemporary audience these characters appear less witty intellectuals, more unbearable stereotypes of champagne socialists and masculine elitism. Brodie, the anti-intellectual anarchist, was a slice of working class, Scottish comic relief. It was a misstep for the Edinburgh audience, as were the jokes about Glasgow. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">It is not the fault of the actors, who manage to cajole a sense of realistic dialogue and genuine chemistry out of Stoppard&rsquo;s dense script. Laurence Fox is an engaging lead, his delivery is spot on and the audience laugh right on cue &ndash; it&rsquo;s hard not to be won over by his romance or self-deprecating humour. The other characters think so too; his wife, mistress and daughter (who, with her black lipstick and fishnets, is an embarrassingly inaccurate example of a teenage girl) might make long speeches about how snobbish his options, but he can silence them with a witty retort. The other, less educated men fade into the background, whilst Henry always comes out on top. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In a play supposedly about love, no one seems to even like each other. Many of the truest lines about love are lost in the rush to get to the next punchline. It&rsquo;s a short play, and there was time to let the characters breathe a little, to allow some tenderness to seep through. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The greatest pity in this version is the wasted potential, the lack of courage in really engaging in what the play could be; a discussion between theatricality and reality. The lights stay up for the scene changes as if to suggest the characters are constantly in a play-within-a-play, but the actors slink off straight away, so it seems as if the technical team simply forgot to fade to blackout. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The result is a disjointed plot, where the audience are left struggling to piece together some deeper meaning. There is a sense of confusion and even disappointment at the painfully smug ending, as though for all of Henry&rsquo;s agonising, all the broken hearts and soul-searching, none of it even mattered. Perhaps that is the point, but it does leave you with a sour taste in your mouth, as though the time invested by the audience was meaningless.&nbsp;&lsquo;The Real Thing&rsquo; is often considered Stoppard&rsquo;s first play with a real heart, yet in this version it barely has a pulse. &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">&#39;The Real Thing&#39; will conclude its UK tour at <em>Theatre Royal,</em> Brighton:&nbsp;Mon&nbsp;30th October 2017 to Sat 4th November 2017</span></strong></p>\r\n', 5, 1, '2017-10-28 18:52:56', '2017-10-30 16:57:02', 'the-real-thing-at-king-s-theatre', 3, NULL, 1),

After he betrays his close friend Hassan at a young age, the audience feels the full extent of the shame that chases him as he leaves Afghanistan to forge a new life in the US, and eventually forces him to return to his home country seeking redemption. Yet despite our despair at Amir&rsquo;s behavior, Ahmad succeeds in maintaining the audience&rsquo;s empathy as play&rsquo;s narrator. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The choice to have the same actor play Amir as a child and as an adult is both effective and chilling, clearly showing us how the choices we make in our childhood can continue to haunt us later in life. Jo Ben Ayed is tremendous in his portrayal of the sweet and loyal Hassan and as a result it is impossible for the audience to remain unmoved by his tragic fate. Hanif Khan also merits a mention as the tabla player who performs live on stage throughout the show, which in addition to the use of traditional singing bowls, completely immerses the audience in the haunting world of <i>The Kite Runner</i>.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Emilio Doorgasingh in the part of Baba does a fantastic job at conveying how individual identity is challenged through the process of migration. Similarly, Amiera Darwish&rsquo;s character Soraya, one of the few female parts in the play, successfully represents the struggle to balance traditional values with adaptation to a new society. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">However, the love story between Soraya and Amir is ultimately unconvincing, as is the supposed tension between Amir, Hassan and their nemesis Assef (played by Bhavin Bhatt). Whilst the climax of their antagonistic relationship is incredibly painful to watch, the relationship both beforehand and after feels underdeveloped, with Assef playing the fool rather than the threatening and manipulative figure we are meant to believe. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Indeed, the play can feel rather unbalanced as a whole, with much of the action taking place in the last thirty minutes of a long performance. Yet fans of the book will be pleased, as this reflects the structure of Hosseini&rsquo;s original novel and the adaptation is in general a very faithful one. However, the opportunity to be more creative with the plot&rsquo;s structure and perhaps explore elements of the story that are not shown in the book, for example Hassan&rsquo;s adulthood, was missed in this adaptation. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In spite of this, I defy anyone not to be moved by the story told. Many of the play&rsquo;s most challenging themes are sadly poignant today. For example, when Amir and his father smuggle themselves out of Afghanistan, their whole life reduced to two suitcases, one is reminded of the huge numbers of refugees making similar journeys every day. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Overall, <i>The Kite Runner</i> is a visually and sonically impressive production that emphasises the importance of friendship. Although the play has many dark moments, it ultimately leaves the audience with hope for redemption. In contrast to Rahim Khan (Karl Seth)&rsquo;s comment, &lsquo;It was the two of us against the world, and the world won,&rsquo; <i>The Kite Runner</i> affirms that when we show courage, the bad guys don&rsquo;t always have to win. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><em><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&#39;The Kite Runner&#39; is touring throughout the UK&nbsp;until June 2018.

(40, 'A Chat with Faris Badwan of the Horrors', 'Dominic Bernard sits down with Faris for a game of guess-the-interview-question. ', '<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/47/content_26.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 529px;\" /></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Faris on stage at the Horrors show in Glasgow&#39;s QMU, October 19 2017.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Faris Badwan&nbsp;lounges in the tiny desk-chair before me.&nbsp;We&rsquo;re in a rather&nbsp;innocuous&nbsp;seminar room at Glasgow&rsquo;s Queen Margaret Union, where tonight&rsquo;s gig seems at odds with the whiteboard and stark lighting. &nbsp;As it turns out, he&rsquo;s extremely nice, and despite it being my first interview and the audio recorder&rsquo;s failure (we used my phone), he&rsquo;s consistently charming. When I mention the fact it&rsquo;s my first, fiddling with his giant skull ring, he offers a game: if he guesses my question, I can&rsquo;t ask it. How can I not accept? The twelve minutes of the interview go by before I even notice, and I find myself apologising for taking his time, and - most bizarrely - wishing him good luck. This too, when the foremost impression I got was just how assured and at home Faris seemed, even in this weird seminar room an hour before performing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The performance itself is fantastic. Preceded by half an hour of brilliant, twisted, psych-rock from support Baba Naga (from whom&nbsp;I&rsquo;d have equally loved a full set), The Horrors launch into a heavy, tight and confident set. &#39;Machine&#39;, <em>V</em>&#39;&#39;s&nbsp;first single, arrives&nbsp;early and hard, where &#39;Something to Remember Me By&#39; closes&nbsp;out, rightfully claiming status as an anthem. The same aggression that Faris mentions having missed in the interview is out in full force: favourites such as &#39;Still Life&#39; still make an appearance, of course, but in a darker and slightly uptempo fashion that whips&nbsp;up the crowd. If you have the opportunity, their show is not one to miss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Horrors&rsquo; album<em> V </em>is out now on Wolf Tone/Caroline International.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Dominic</strong>: Do you wanna guess your first?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Faris</strong>: Ok, so.. What were your influences on this record?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: Yeah, that was was the obvious one!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: Ah, well we can strike that one out then. Why the change from Luminous to V, why the change in sound? Is that one?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: No</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: No?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: I&rsquo;m gonna ask a similar one though, so.. Is V a return to that more gothic noise, or has it always been there?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: Well, I always thought that our live shows were a lot more aggressive than our records - even on the first album - because, I mean when you listen to live recordings, of us playing the first record, it&rsquo;s almost un-listenable. I mean it&rsquo;s like.. It&rsquo;s just a f*cking screeching mess. You know, In this.. I mean I f*cking hate musicians so that&rsquo;s fine, but it&rsquo;s like.. I don&rsquo;t like people who can - who&rsquo;ve learnt to play their instruments in a conventional way - I like people who&rsquo;ve picked up the instrument, and they&rsquo;ve kind of been inspired to do something else with it - even if that means making a complete racket. So I&rsquo;m into that. But yeah I mean I was singing twice as fast as everyone else was playing, it was a mess! But yeah, like I said, I enjoy that. So, on this record, it kind of felt like we&rsquo;d gone so long without&hellip; aggression, that, we wanted a bit of it back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: Do you wanna continue the game?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: What did Paul Epworth bring to your new record, V?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: No.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: No? Jeez, ok, You&rsquo;re ahead, you&rsquo;re ahead</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: I&rsquo;m ahead?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: 2 to 1</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: Do you have any pre-gig rituals that you guys always go to?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: Pre gig rituals&hellip; I did, well, I do.. I got this inhaler that - Have you seen blue velvet? Ok, well Blue Velvet, Dennis Hopper, makes his return to the big screen, after some, after a period of.. wilderness, and he&rsquo;s got this mask that he puts over his mouth like this [he mimes] and he kind of.. he sounds really terrifying, so I&rsquo;ve got a mask that I put over my face to inhale steam, and then that steam warms up my voice, and since then I haven&rsquo;t lost my voice - that&rsquo;s the closest thing I have to a ritual. Josh [Guitarist] just sleeps for an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: Nice, that - that&rsquo;s really impressive, like I had no idea that that would..</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: No, I thought actually, I dunno why more.. I&rsquo;m sure singers do it, I&rsquo;m sure lots of people do it, otherwise it wouldn&rsquo;t exist, but I thought I want to design one that&rsquo;s one, that&rsquo;s made of one piece, &lsquo;cause I thought.. it&rsquo;s not - the top bit melts, sometimes</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: Yeah - how do you do that, just got a kettle, and you&rsquo;re like huffing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: No, it&rsquo;s a little beaker, you know those ones you have when you&rsquo;re a kid that, that right themselves if you knock them over? It&rsquo;s a bit like that, and it&rsquo;s got a plastic mouthpiece, but yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: Nice&hellip; Another one?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: OK&hellip; Alright well this will be the end of your interview, if you ask it: What can we expect from the upcoming tour, with The Horrors?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: No</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: [laughs]</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: Told you I&rsquo;m bad at this</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: No no, it means you&rsquo;re good, this is a good thing. I&rsquo;m supposed to lose, and I&rsquo;ll be happy, if I lose, I&rsquo;m happy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: If you were dictator, what would your first law be?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: Brilliant, that&rsquo;s great, never had that one. First law&hellip; ok&hellip; well, I mean the thing is, you know, you say something and then probably later on think of something more important. But&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: It&rsquo;s only your first, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be the most important</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: You&rsquo;re right, I know, but if I was dictator I&rsquo;d want to make a statement.. Yeah I dunno, I think I&rsquo;d probably make.. Yeah am I dictator of the world?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: World is fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: Did you know that in Ireland, certain parts, abortion is not legal? That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: Yeah..</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: And you get more time in jail, if you get raped and abort the child, than you do if you&rsquo;re raping someone. How crazy is that? So&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: Yeah, that&rsquo;s - that&rsquo;s nuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: Yeah. So I&rsquo;d probably do something to do with women&rsquo;s rights. Abortion is legal, everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: Nice. If you weren&rsquo;t doing this, i.e. being [lead singer of] The Horrors, I mean, what would you be doing, do you think? Still down south?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: I definitely wouldn&rsquo;t be where I grew up.. I think.. I was studying to be an architect, and I didn&rsquo;t ever really think about it, so I kind of.. I dunno, it&rsquo;s weird how you sort of find your level, eventually, maybe you don&rsquo;t, I dunno&hellip; But yeah, so I was studying illustration, and then I just ended up being away more and more, so I guess maybe a painter or something? I don&rsquo;t know, I mean I paint a lot and I do exhibitions, maybe I&rsquo;d do that. If it ended I&rsquo;d do that. If it ended and I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to make music, then I&rsquo;d do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: Nice, have you got a favourite writing spot?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: I&rsquo;m impressed, I like your questions &lsquo;cause they&rsquo;re really, they&rsquo;re not boring&hellip; and honestly&hellip; the amount of boring questions&hellip; [laughs]</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: I can imagine..</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: Usually I start playing games to amuse myself, otherwise&hellip; Because I think it&rsquo;s just a... a band is just a way to avoid boredom, more than anything else&hellip; It&rsquo;s like, you wanna find a way in your life of having fun, and that&rsquo;s what it is&hellip; &nbsp;But yeah, writing spot, I dunno, I mean I have gone different places, we went, on this record, recently I went to iceland, because I&rsquo;d spent two weeks trying to write one line of the lyrics, and I was going a bit mad - and it wasn&rsquo;t even an important line - and I was just staring at a computer screen trying to do it, and it wasn&rsquo;t happening, so we went to Iceland, and... we saw no-one the whole time, and we saw the northern lights... and yeah, we got the lyrics finished. So, I&rsquo;d go back there. Sometimes I go to Manchester, which is a little different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: If you walked into a record store now, and you were gonna pick up a record, old or new, what record would it be?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: Well I guess it would be one that I didn&rsquo;t have, so&hellip; I feel like I have all the old bands, that you&rsquo;d find in a record shop. I mean obviously not, but, you know, the more famous ones... So I&rsquo;d probably, I feel like there&rsquo;s a lot of new bands that I don&rsquo;t know but I might like, &lsquo;cause, we went to The Q Awards yesterday, and they had a &lsquo;Best New Band&rsquo; category, and I realised I only knew half of them. And then... I was thinking that maybe... Because there are a lot of good new bands. There&rsquo;s a band that I work with that&rsquo;s called Happy Meal Ltd., I produced their first single, they&rsquo;re really good. A bit like The Horrors when we started, but a lot more colourful. There&rsquo;s this band that I&rsquo;m working with called &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s Eat Grandma&rsquo;, these two girls from Norwich, both... don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re 18 yet... but they&rsquo;re on their second album.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: Damn, already?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: Yeah yeah, and they&rsquo;re really good. &lsquo;SOPHIE&rsquo;? do you know the electronic music producer &lsquo;SOPHIE&rsquo;? Kind of started off with PC music, do you know those people?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: Afraid not, something to check out!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: Yeah well, there&rsquo;s lots of stuff that I don&rsquo;t know, so I&rsquo;d go to a record store and pick up a sleeve that I liked, that I didn&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d do. &nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s rare to find a record sleeve that you really love, and completely hate the music, because it kind of goes with the aesthetic, yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: Yeah</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: Sort of, it&rsquo;s not always true, but yeah I&rsquo;d do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: Nice. The video for Something to Remember me by, that&rsquo;s nuts, I&rsquo;ve not seen a video like that in a long time...</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: Well, you nearly saw two within the space of three weeks, because the band that I mentioned, Happy Meal Ltd., three days after our video came out, they got sent a treatment by a different director, that was almost word for word exactly the same as our video. They called me up and said they weren&rsquo;t sure if it was coincidence (or if he just ripped it off), but yeah- so you could have seen two completely identical videos. But yeah I think the guy did a good job, Max Weiland. I&rsquo;ve hated... I&rsquo;ve had a problem with videos, for a long time, because I feel like we haven&rsquo;t always had good ones. It&rsquo;s hard being in a band of five people, because it ends up quite diplomatic, to the point where no-one gets what they want, so we&rsquo;ve tried to be a little bit more&hellip; sort of... focused on different people&rsquo;s opinions at different points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: Sure, nice&hellip; The body horror aspects, I guess, of the video, and like the imagery for the new album, is that a new thing? Like is that something that&rsquo;s suddenly popped up? &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: Yeah, because I thought, I&nbsp;kinda&nbsp;felt like we got to a point where you would know what kind of sleeve to expect from The Horrors, and I was - we were all getting really bored of it, it just became this like&hellip; I&nbsp;dunno, I never even thought we were particularly a &lsquo;psych band&rsquo; or whatever, in the traditional sense anyway, but we got that label. And all the psych bands have similar artwork, so, you know.. I felt it was a bit too comfortable. That was kind of the point with this new record, we felt like everything about the process had become too comfortable&hellip; so having something grotesque, and using&nbsp;CGI, which [we] haven&rsquo;t done before... I just thought it was fun, you know, it&rsquo;s kind of...</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: Yeah, it&rsquo;s new&hellip; Yeah I really liked all of the artwork and the videos, they&rsquo;re really good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: We&rsquo;re trying to do an&nbsp;anime, for the next video, but.. Have you seen Ghost in the Shell? The guy who produced it got in touch and wanted to do a video, but then he said one minute of Ghost in the Shell cost &pound;100,000 [laughs]</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: No... Damn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: Yeah, imagine how much the whole film cost, it&rsquo;s crazy. So actually.. you know. That&rsquo;s not going to happen. But we&rsquo;re trying to find another way of doing it...</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>D</strong>: Maybe collaboration... Anyway, thanks man, it&rsquo;s really kind of you to give me the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>F</strong>: That&rsquo;s alright, likewise, don&rsquo;t mind at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 53, 1, '2017-10-30 15:36:01', '2017-11-01 19:05:40', 'a-chat-with-faris-badwan-of-the-horrors', 1, NULL, 1),

A second generation Italian American couple and their orphaned niece are tested by the arrival of the wife&rsquo;s cousins from the homeland. Marco and Rodolpho have come to Brooklyn to seek their fortune and fulfil the American dream, but find the land of the free oppresses its citizens in ways that will be darkly revealed. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">It&rsquo;s become a bit of a clich&eacute; to relate any American narrative to current events across the Pond, but it&rsquo;s hard to resist drawing parallels between this explosive portrayal of fragile masculinity and the despotic figures currently occupying our headline space. Taking on the role of the play&rsquo;s antihero, Eddie, Paddy Echlin&rsquo;s command of the stage was an extraordinary exploration of obsession and control, sensitively negotiated against Eleanor Crowe&rsquo;s sweet and hopeful Catherine. They were joined in their family unit by Tilly Botsford as Beatrice. These three actors worked together to gradually push a strained domestic dynamic to its limits, and to reveal the tension growing out of everything left unsaid. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Henry Coldstream and Leo Sartain played the Italian cousins whose arrival in Brooklyn changes everything. Whilst the object of Catherine&rsquo;s romantic desire, Rodolpho, was portrayed with a sinister charm, Sartain&rsquo;s reserved and controlled energy in his approach to Marco was carefully considered. He could have easily fallen victim to stereotyping the character with overplayed caricatures of an Italian native, but he negotiates the parameters of the role with a graceful maturity.&nbsp; Although never quite slipping into the realm of unfiltered testosterone, the stage space bubbled and simmered with the fragility of the characters&rsquo; masculinity and the claustrophobia of a neighbourhood where everybody talks. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The costumes and set were both excellent, with the exposed living room working to illustrate the tension between interior and exterior that finally explodes in the play&rsquo;s second act; the whole crew should be praised for their creative manipulation of the stage space. The characters that periodically invaded the home space to invite Eddie bowling provided an excellent framing device, charting the patriarch&rsquo;s loss of control and descent into obsession.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Despite holding its own amongst the most professional of Bedlam plays that I&rsquo;ve seen, the shifting locale of the action is tricky to pull off. The suggestion of the other &lsquo;submarine&rsquo; characters, the immigrants who had arrived &lsquo;underwater&rsquo; from Italy to live upstairs from the family, were rushed and seemed like an afterthought. &nbsp;Similarly, Miller&rsquo;s inclusion of a chorus figure Alfieri, played conservatively but authentically by Peter Morrison, was at times disconnected and lacked the sense of authority necessary for a narrative role. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Overall, though, the production successfully brought the streets of Brooklyn to life. Those tricky American accents were held with relative ease and the tone was controlled throughout, resulting in a chilling but ultimately satisfying climax. Andra Gavin as director has handled Arthur Miller&rsquo;s mastery of tension with maturity and sensitivity. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 5, 1, '2017-10-30 16:37:44', '2017-10-30 16:56:33', 'a-view-from-the-bridge-at-bedlam-theatre', 3, NULL, 1),

With crowd participation they begin to create the bones of what would become the performance. When asked what scared them as kids the crowd replies with things such as &lsquo;spiders&rsquo;, &lsquo;clowns&rsquo;, and &lsquo;basements&rsquo;. It is put to an audience vote, and &lsquo;basements&rsquo; are chosen as the basis of the upcoming show. The next task posed to the crowd is that of naming a scary place. One audience member loudly voiced &ldquo;France!&rdquo;. Everyone bursts into laughter and so the show is titled &lsquo;Basements in France&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &lsquo;movie&rsquo; begins with a young woman Tabitha (played by Mike Gorman) getting ready to go on a date with her boyfriend Chad. She is having snarky banter with her great pal, Alexa the artificial intelligence console (played by William Matthew Knapp). Alexa provides the smarts that Tabitha is lacking. Lapping up the witty female back-and-forth, the crowd is quickly laughing hard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boyfriend Chad (played by Lance Fuller) soon comes into the scene and initiates a series of phallic-based jokes. It is made clear that Chad does not live up to girlfriend Tabitha&rsquo;s standards. Rips on Chad continue throughout the show, never failing to entertain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The couple then sets off to France, where they get into a plane crash.

Each film presented a short and often humorous insight into assorted secret selves, hidden habits and mysterious goings-on, tackling the theme in original and innovative ways, and providing an array of moving and very human narratives.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The screening opened with the Swedish film &lsquo;<strong>People in Cars</strong>&rsquo;, which slowly builds up 6 separate stories. The film focuses on the truth of human relationships, beautifully presented through the perspective of people whilst in transit, an in-between space that is at the same time highly personal. The conversations all follow a similar narrative of a hidden secret being tentatively brought out into the open. For example, a young hipster&rsquo;s love for his engaged best friend, or a mother learning of her son&rsquo;s secret online girlfriend from the Philippines. The cleverly executed dialogue allows the tension to rise and peak almost imperceptibly. At times extremely funny and at others slightly awkward, People in Cars is a beautiful snapshot of the secrets of individuals, and how they are revealed to those closest to them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lsquo;<strong>Princess</strong>&rsquo;, from German filmmaker No&euml;mi Schneider, tackles the issue of gender identity, following a young boy who is involved in a group of smoking, mask-cladded bullies. Busted by his next-door neighbour and victim, who catches him dancing in the mirror in makeup and a dress, they begin a friendship based on bribery and exchange. He will help her train for a dance competition and she won&rsquo;t expose his secret self. The film movingly explores the collision between the boy&rsquo;s need to emphasise his masculinity - impressing his father and aggressive friends &ndash; and the secret femininity that is connected to his lost mother.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nominated for best foreign film at the LA independent film festival, &lsquo;<strong>Victor</strong>&rsquo; was another ingenious take on a secret identity, with a surprising twist at the end. Paul Menville&rsquo;s French thriller follows a mysterious man who drives around a deserted town, picking up women on an apparent murder spree. In black and white, the mood is sombre and dramatic. At gas stations, in bars, and in the stairwell of his apartment he interacts with three different women, and reflects on his deep love for a girl who pops up everywhere he goes. One particularly memorable scene, he finds himself in the town bar, sitting among a fantastic array of alternative punk characters who sit smoking, drinking and staring wearily into the distance. Then towards the end, Menville skilfully reveals the true complexity of this man&rsquo;s secret self, forcing the viewer to look back over the interactions portrayed throughout the film in a new light &ndash; a brilliant film!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The British film &lsquo;<strong>EWWW</strong>&rsquo; stood out for its sheer humour and original take on the theme of secret selves. It opens halfway through a date that is coated in awkwardness, overcompensated for with excellently acted and slightly manic laughter on the girl&rsquo;s part, who starts bombarding her date with Google&rsquo;s top first date questions. The snappy dialogue is extremely well-written and appeals to a more British sense of humour, which delights in the awkward. We watch as the girl dares him to tell her his biggest secret, and her resultant wide eyes as he whispers something in her ear. We then find ourselves in the guy&rsquo;s apartment, the mood taking a slightly more sinister turn as the man&rsquo;s secret remains undisclosed. The girl slips out of bed as he sleeps and sneaks a look at his DVDs - which is where the truth of his secret self is documented. Like so many of the short films over the course of the evening, the secret that is revealed is not at all what the audience expects; the tension breaks and the sheer ingenuity of the storyline shocks us into ending the film laughing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Catalina Jordan&rsquo;s film &lsquo;<strong>Paco</strong>&rsquo; was another highlight of the evening. Winner of best picture at Fantastic Fest in Austin, the experimental and quite bizarre story centres around a man who sits in the park calling at passers-by. Visually the film is exciting, colourful and autumnal and the execution of this strange narrative, these peculiar yet affirming interactions with a man in a park, is excellent. The film is daring, hilarious and beautiful.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Overall &lsquo;<strong>Secret Selves</strong>&rsquo; was a fantastic evening; the selection of films had a really international feel, showcasing a series of eclectic, imaginative and creative stories that were at once entirely relatable yet totally bizarre.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">&#39;Secret Selves&#39; was part of the <a href=\"http://www.edinburghshortfilmfestival.com/2017-programme/\">Edinburgh Short Film Festival,</a> which runs until 11th November 2017.</span></span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 5, 1, '2017-10-30 17:32:52', '2017-10-30 18:40:46', 'edinburgh-short-film-festival-day-2', 3, NULL, 1),

We&rsquo;re doing venues a lot smaller than what we can do now but I think it&rsquo;s important to go to these cities when people can&rsquo;t always reach the big cities like Glasgow.&nbsp;Obviously, Edinburgh&rsquo;s on this one, it&rsquo;s a little bit different, but in England we&rsquo;ve been doing cities like Coventry and Dover, places you wouldn&rsquo;t usually go, so it&rsquo;s been interesting. </font></font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0px 0px 11px\"><b><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Calibri\"><font size=\"3\">How would you compare performing at a small intimate venue to a larger one?

We&rsquo;ve been making sure everything is right and I&rsquo;ve rerecorded tracks twice in two different studios to make them sound right. Also, I&rsquo;m doing some collaborations with other artists, I won&rsquo;t mention any names, but quite well-known artists which is exciting, and the album will be out early next year.</font></font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0px 0px 11px\"><b><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Calibri\"><font size=\"3\">You&rsquo;re a versatile artist, what sort of sound will the album have?</font></font></font></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0px 0px 11px\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Calibri\"><font size=\"3\">Well I think anyone can get on that stage and just smash those cymbals and just say &lsquo;this is indie music&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s easy &ndash; I could do that in my sleep. I think it&rsquo;s important to do the rock-n-roll stuff and then also be able to showcase another side and show that I can write these slow songs, these ballads. </font></font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0px 0px 11px\"><b><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Calibri\"><font size=\"3\">How would you describe your approach to writing?

I don&rsquo;t think about it too much though, for me it&rsquo;s a duty to write - I have to write. I&rsquo;ll wake up and go do a few hours in the gym and then I&rsquo;ll go home and then I&rsquo;ll literally write all night. It&rsquo;ll take me anywhere between five minutes and an hour to write a song - I used to be a lot quicker, but now I think about it a little bit more. Obviously when you start working with bigger producers, and have better studios and better musicians you learn a lot and you have to become a little more methodical which I don&rsquo;t like, but it is necessary at times. </font></font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0px 0px 11px\"><b><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Calibri\"><font size=\"3\">You said you&rsquo;ve been writing for other artists as well, is that something you enjoy or do you prefer writing for your own music? </font></font></font></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0px 0px 11px\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Calibri\"><font size=\"3\">I enjoy all aspects of writing - I write songs for girls and things like that you know what I mean? I think it&rsquo;s important, as I said, to showcase different styles of writing and that for me is what an artist is. I&rsquo;m trying to be an artist- I don&rsquo;t want to be a performer. I don&rsquo;t want to stand there singing someone else&rsquo;s songs and lie to people that are paying money for gigs-&nbsp;that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m about. So I&rsquo;ll write a song that&rsquo;s true to me and if people like it, they like it and if they don&rsquo;t, they don&rsquo;t - as long as it&rsquo;s honest.</font></font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0px 0px 11px\"><b><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Calibri\"><font size=\"3\">It&rsquo;s refreshing to see you up there with just your guitar, do you think it&rsquo;s a problem with the industry that more and more artists are going up on stage with laptops and other electronic equipment?</font></font></font></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0px 0px 11px\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Calibri\"><font size=\"3\">I hate it.&nbsp;People are paying money for gig tickets and they&rsquo;re coming to watch a live performance. I&rsquo;d say 80% - even more, 90% of bands I&rsquo;ve seen on the road have got some kind of backing track playing. People who haven&rsquo;t got a trained ear to that kind of thing won&rsquo;t always notice it but I&rsquo;ve been at festivals or touring with people and they&rsquo;ve been on the stage and I&rsquo;ve heard these vocals coming out yet no one&rsquo;s on stage yet! I can&rsquo;t do that, I have to be honest with the fans musically.</font></font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0px 0px 11px\"><b><span style=\"margin:0px; color:#0d0d0d\"><font face=\"Calibri\"><font size=\"3\">&nbsp;</font></font></span></b><b><span style=\"margin:0px; color:#0d0d0d\"><font face=\"Calibri\"><font size=\"3\">Which artists do you admire at the moment? </font></font></span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0px 0px 11px\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Calibri\"><font size=\"3\">I don&rsquo;t know you, you know&hellip; There&rsquo;s aspects that I like of lots of different artists. I like a lot of American artists and I&rsquo;m into my rap and things like that, that&rsquo;s the kind of background I come from. It&rsquo;s just by chance that I fell into making guitar music. I like the likes of J. Cole, I think he&rsquo;s a really honest writer and he&rsquo;s great at what he does. In terms of British artists, I think that Sam Smith&nbsp;is great; I&rsquo;ve got the same producer and I&rsquo;ve heard some of Sam&rsquo;s stuff before it&rsquo;s out and honestly all I can say is that people are really gonna love it. It&rsquo;s really good music. We&rsquo;re using the same gospel singers and things like that on some of the tracks and I&rsquo;m excited to hear all of his stuff when it comes out. I think he&rsquo;s a great artist. </font></font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0px 0px 11px\"><b><span style=\"margin:0px; color:#0d0d0d\"><font face=\"Calibri\"><font size=\"3\">Tell me the story of your grandad&rsquo;s guitar and how you discovered music.</font></font></span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0px 0px 11px\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Calibri\"><font size=\"3\">Well my grandfather plays the guitar, but he only plays three chords - he&rsquo;ll play you any song with those three chords though. He had a guitar at the bottom of his bed, and I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to touch it but I had a little go. I still remember the first four chords I played &ndash; funnily enough I&rsquo;ve never written a song with those chords but I should do, I was thinking about it the other day. Anyway, I showed him that I could play the guitar and he bought me a banjo! He said &quot;play a banjo, everyone plays the guitar&quot; and &quot;you&#39;ll go further with a banjo&quot;. But you can&#39;t write rock n roll songs on a banjo so I switched back over to the guitar. </font></font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0px 0px 11px\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Calibri\"><font size=\"3\">&nbsp;</font></font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0px 0px 11px\"><b><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Calibri\"><font size=\"3\">Where do you think you&#39;d be if that moment hadn&#39;t happened?

The background I&#39;m from is not a normal background of the people that get into music or even people in my band - they&#39;re coming out of universities or things like that. It&rsquo;s a great thing for them to learn aspects of music in that way but I&rsquo;m from a completely different route, I was a criminal before I got involved in music and music gave me my only avenue away from that lifestyle so I&#39;m very grateful to be here doing what I&#39;m doing. </font></font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0px 0px 11px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0px 0px 11px\"><b><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Calibri\"><font size=\"3\">What have you learnt so far from being in the industry and what advice would you give to an aspiring young artist? </font></font></font></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0px 0px 11px\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Calibri\"><font size=\"3\">Well don&rsquo;t let people change your minds that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d say, but who am I to say? I&rsquo;m no expert here.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m still trying to achieve what I need to achieve, and when I do achieve that, maybe I&rsquo;ll have a little bit more advice.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve got a lot to learn. </font></font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0px 0px 11px\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Calibri\"><font size=\"3\">But I think just stay true to yourself, don&rsquo;t let anyone change your mind or persuade you in any way and don&rsquo;t try and sound like other artists. I hear so many bands trying to sound like other people, but by the time you&rsquo;ve released that stuff you&rsquo;ve copied off a band you like, that band will be old news. So, it&rsquo;s pointless - times change fast. When I started with this sound, you know it&rsquo;s like a rock-n-roll sound, people think it can be compared to older stuff, but if I told you it was gunna be getting &#39;hottest record&#39; on Radio 1 and things like that you would&rsquo;ve laughed at me. That single was played on Radio 1 and it&rsquo;s rock-n-roll music - anything&rsquo;s possible if you stay true to yourself. </font></font></font></p>\r\n', 139, 1, '2017-10-30 20:40:59', '2017-10-31 11:19:16', 'interview-with-louis-berry', 1, NULL, 1),

They explaining that&nbsp;the song is&nbsp;an exploration of mental illness, which gives the lyrics new, thought-provoking meaning. Between songs singer Irwin Sparkes entertains&nbsp;the crowd with what can only be described as slightly awkward dad banter, reflecting perhaps that the Hoosiers golden days are indeed back in a previous decade, yet the band&nbsp;clearly perform&nbsp;with the same warm nostalgic enthusiasm as the audience, and they certainly get the crowd dancing. In a time when cheesy pop-rock is almost obsolete, and heavy bass-ridden big-name DJs dominate the industry, it is&nbsp;lovely to sing along to silly songs about superheroes and &lsquo;Cops and Robbers&rsquo; once again, and remember a band&nbsp;the majority of the audience&nbsp;would have grown up with. Having seen The Hoosiers myself when I was 12 (my first ever gig!) the night is particularly heartwarming.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After finishing the set, the band return&nbsp;with a lengthy encore, no longer sticking to the first album. This is where the band are&nbsp;able to showcase their true&nbsp;technical abilities. Perhaps the most memorable song of the show was an excellent and unexpected cover of the Weeknd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t Feel My Face&rsquo;, performing a psychedelic, guitar-heavy, slower version that works&nbsp;excellently. The full, impressive range of Sparkes&rsquo;s vocals were put on show here as he breaks into a powerful falsetto, and the extended guitar solo brings on cheers from the crowd. Once again, it is lovely to see the band clearly having a lot of fun onstage, the anniversary tour absolutely coming about due to a love of performing and a wish to revisit, perhaps for the last time, the success that dominated their early career. As Sparkes joked, &lsquo;you can buy our merch, or not, we don&rsquo;t need the money!&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nUltimately, the evening is a fun, nostalgic, cheesy night for band and audience, with their final song &lsquo;Choices&rsquo; leaving people singing down the street after the gig. Their sound might not quite have caught up with this decade, but no-one can deny the deserved success of <em>The Trick to Life-</em>&nbsp;the album that catapulted The Hoosiers to fame 10 years ago.&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 61, 1, '2017-11-04 16:04:46', '2017-11-07 12:30:05', 'the-hoosiers-at-potterow', 1, NULL, 1),

Although just 65 minutes long, its brazen depiction of an intensely toxic relationship leaves the audience exhausted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play opens with Jo and Harry, played by Cassandra Cassidy and Sam Coade, having sex and watching porn. Jo is evidently disinterested, eating Wotsits and not looking at Harry. It&rsquo;s a shocking image, and one that captures the outrageous yet dispassionate play nicely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;The One&rsquo; takes place over the course of a single night, as Jo and Harry wait for news of Jo&rsquo;s sister, who is in labour. The real tension begins when Kerry, one of Harry&rsquo;s colleagues - it later emerges that both Harry and Kerry taught Jo at university -&nbsp;turns up uninvited, declaring that her boyfriend has raped her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jo&rsquo;s reaction is appallingly cruel, questioning and laughing at Kerry&#39;s claim, before announcing that Kerry is the true rapist because she did not say no or push her boyfriend away. Jo&rsquo;s attitude is clearly an extreme example of the way society consistently undermines victims of sexual violence; she&rsquo;s immediately categorised as a vindictive bully, and the horrifying product of rape culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, things are not quite that straightforward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The power that Jo seems to hold swiftly dissipates as Harry declares that he does &lsquo;things like that&rsquo; to her &lsquo;all the time&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the play progresses, the audience are forced to constantly question Jo and Harry&rsquo;s relationship: do they even like each other or are they just lying and taunting their way through the evening? Harry appears to be controlling and abusive, although to what extent he is acting out Jo&rsquo;s fantasies is not clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The power balance between the two swings wildly, and it is sometimes hard to keep up. The actors cope well with the constantly changing dynamics. Jo spends the entire play dressed only in lacy underwear, which makes her seem both incredibly vulnerable and intimidatingly confident at the same time. One of the most shocking moments of the play is a somewhat gratuitous rape fantasy scene, especially as it is not clear whether or not it is consensual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consent and power in relationships are the main themes of &lsquo;The One&rsquo;, and it certainly encourages the audience to reflect on the way that we deal with these issues in society. However, what exactly it is trying to say about these issues is not that clear. This was by no means the fault of the actors, who dealt very well with the intense script, which had the potential to seem exaggerated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;The One&rsquo; is a play that opens up difficult questions without providing easy answers. It forces the audience to consider them, but refuse to lay down a blueprint for how we should go about it.</p>\r\n', 5, 1, '2017-11-07 18:21:44', '2017-11-07 18:25:14', 'the-one-at-bedlam-theatre', 3, NULL, 1),

(49, 'Edinburgh Short Film Festival: Day 5', 'reviewed by Anna Staufenberg', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fifth night of the <strong>Edinburgh Short Film Festival</strong> was a collection of short documentaries, all exploring the back-alleys of identity, group mentality and anonymity. With five of the seven films based in Scotland, the audience expected a distinctly more comfortable &lsquo;home-turf&rsquo; feel to the evening. All of the films, however, approached the genre of documentary in equally surprising and engaging ways, to deliver a beautifully crafted peek into the lifestyles and obstacles of many varying characters in a contemporary society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The night opened with &lsquo;<strong>Ma Bar</strong>&rsquo;. Winner of the BAFTA Scotland Best Short Film back in 2009, the film documents the obsessive lifestyle followed by Bill McFadyen, the 73 year old world champion bench presser from a small town on the south-west coast of Scotland. Using almost entirely close-up facial shots and accompanied by snippets of Bill&rsquo;s own narration, the film is intimately moulded around the bodily and mental extremes which some are determined to achieve. Very engaging yet at times unsettling, &lsquo;Ma Bar&rsquo; creates a well-crafted juxtaposition of aesthetic pleasure and the shock factor of human endeavour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lsquo;<strong>Commodity City</strong>&rsquo; stood out for its sheer originality, beautiful shots and sense of humour. One of the two international films of the evening, it has been screened worldwide and has won various short documentary prizes. Set in the world&rsquo;s largest wholesale market in the Chinese city of Yiwu, the audience is given a beautiful 11 minute insight into the life of the stall owners whom we daily take for granted. The sellers, full of life and individuality, are isolated in their own cubicle stalls, set against an oppressive backdrop of cheap pens, toys and hairdryers. A sombre man in charge of a pen shop takes care to painstakingly count metal parts on his desk; an elderly lady sweet talks one of her customer, insulting and complimenting him at the same time; a woman shouts at her son for hitting another child on the head with a toy. With barely any dialogue and the continuum of tinny mall music playing in the background, &lsquo;Commodity City&rsquo; presents a seamless montage of individual shots which individually seem insignificant on the surface, but which combine to take on new weight and meaning; a brilliant film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also Scottish-themed, &#39;<strong>The Big Lie</strong>&rsquo; skilfully weaves in historical events with contemporary issues and trends. An interview with one of the last surviving members of the Scottish International Brigades forms the template for the film, through which we learn about the hundreds of Scottish men and women who, between 1936-39, volunteered to fight for the Spanish Republic against the fascist regimes of Hitler and Mussolini. The big lies that Fascists weave into society come to the fore in the course of the film, as well as the stupidity of the masses in following. The well-crafted interview is cleverly combined with original historical footage, and slowly climaxes to turn the focus back around at the end of the film; the significance of mass media and the redefinition of truth is, sadly, just as relevant almost 100 years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lsquo;<strong>The Devil and the Holy Water</strong>&rsquo; also explores human extremes. Shot on location in Addis Abeba, Ethiopa, anthropologist Diego Malara sheds light on the power held by controversial exorcism priest Mehmer Girma, whose charisma draws hundreds from across the country. Narrated entirely by a woman who has herself been exorcised by Girma, we watch individuals screaming and writhing as Girma, standing on a stage and equipped with a microphone, forces the devil to reveal itself. With close-up intimate shots that often last longer than would ordinarily be comfortable, &lsquo;The Devil and the Holy Water&rsquo; reveals the shocking reality of contemporary exorcism practice with a distinctly eerie feel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All in all, the short documentary night of the <strong>ESFF</strong> was an extremely interesting evening, at times shocking and at others very funny, and offered intimate glances into seven very different realities. A common theme developed as the films merged into a collective, one of appreciating the difficulties surrounding identities in a contemporary world; yet&nbsp;these are difficulties we must respond to whilst holding together rather than dividing.</p>\r\n', 73, 1, '2017-11-08 16:39:35', '2017-11-08 16:40:33', 'edinburgh-short-film-festival-day-5', 3, NULL, 0),

I could have put it out in January. In the past releasing&nbsp;<i>Green Green Grasses</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Gold</i>, I found what happened for me is that the album came and went. The was a lot of hype to this album, comes out on Monday or Friday lots of hype and the next day everyone forgets about it&hellip; and I didn&rsquo;t want that to happen for this album just because I wanted to do a lot more, I wanted growth between the other albums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To take it a step further, I&rsquo;ll let you guys know first is that the plan for next year is to put out the visuals. So what I plan to do now is do videos for the song that will have different versions. It means that the videos will be a different mix to what was on the playlist release and the album. And when all the visuals get released next year, I can combine that and turn that into a deluxe version of the album or just keep it as is. It&rsquo;s the exact same plan as with the album, we&rsquo;ll be releasing the visuals slowly. I&rsquo;m super excited, I&rsquo;m not sure what the first visual is going to be, but it might be &lsquo;Kill the Body&rsquo; or &lsquo;Wedadi&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve been speaking to the director last night and it&rsquo;s crazy!

It&rsquo;s more highlife influenced music that&rsquo;s traditionally known to have a lot of horns, a lot of percussion and [similar to] groups like Osibisa. Osibisa were very big in the 60&rsquo;s. Pat Thomas is another legendary Ghanaian musician, but then also along the region you have Fela Kuti, who&rsquo;s Nigerian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ghanaians and Nigerians are pretty much cousins, but it all comes from the highlife sound which for me is mainly Ghanaian, Nigerian. The new album carries a lot of those undertones, it&rsquo;s mainly the horn section behind the inspiration, the percussion and also the texture. I find that listening to stuff like Fela Kuti or Osibisa from the 60&rsquo;s, the music wasn&rsquo;t clean. The music wasn&rsquo;t as digitized as it is today and you&rsquo;d have a room where you&rsquo;d stick drums and horns together and you&rsquo;d play and there would be different faults and different mistakes. But it&rsquo;s just part of the feel of the music and I just wanted to make something that carried that slightly distorted and dirty music. I felt music was going a bit too clean but for me it&rsquo;s mainly Ghanaian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>A: you&rsquo;ve got these music videos coming up next year. What does it look like down the line?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>K:</b>&nbsp;Great question! It&rsquo;s weird, it looks like more albums as they come. I don&rsquo;t like to say when an albums coming. It looks like living a lot more life- using my experiences and what I&rsquo;ve been able to achieve and also passing it on to someone can actually do more. I&rsquo;m a bit older now so I just want to look to other artists, help younger artists, whether that be in a management role or even in an advisory role. Just live more life and put out music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After next year when the visuals are out, it looks like more tours. I&rsquo;m super excited- one of the reasons [is because] the way I recorded it uses a lot of the&nbsp;highlife&nbsp;influences. Culturally it&rsquo;s a lot of call and response type of music. In Ghana if you go to the villages, it&rsquo;s such that when someone sings, the crowd responds. It&rsquo;s community based music. So I&rsquo;m excited to get on the road and perform this album as much as possible. I think a lot of people will understand the music more when it&rsquo;s performed on stage. I think down the road it looks like a lot more shows and music, maybe just getting myself in other roles. A lot of people don&rsquo;t know I produce, that&rsquo;s the thing&hellip;. I love to produce for other artists and send music out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kobi Onyame will be performing at The Poetry Club/SW3G in Glasgow on December 2, 2017 and The Waiting Room in London, 1 February 2018.

Two talented supporting bands, Super Inuit and Night Flowers, take the stage and as each act goes on, the room steadily fills. By the time it is Japanese Breakfast&rsquo;s turn to take the stage, it is nearly a full house.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Japanese Breakfast is touring in support of their new album <em>Soft Sounds from Another Planet</em>. They open the show with the first track off this album entitled &lsquo;Diving Woman&rsquo;. This almost ambient song foreshadows the tones of the record. Immediately the crowd is bobbing along. Next the band throws in two of their more popular songs from their first album, <em>Psychopomp</em>. These songs are &#39;In Heaven&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Woman that Loves You&rsquo;.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The vocals of lead singer and mastermind of the band, Michelle Zauner, radiate throughout the crowd. Matched with the sonic instrumentation, the result is a hypnotically unique sound. The talent of this four-piece band is undeniable.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With the band grooving and the songs flowing, the crowd is almost involuntarily dancing along. A shift in tone comes about three-quarters of the way into the show. Saying they are going to slow things down, the four-piece band reduces to a two-piece. This leaves only Zauner and drummer Craig Hendrix. In this manner, they play three songs, including the standout &lsquo;Till Death&rsquo;. Zauner introduces &lsquo;Till Death&rsquo; as a song about marriage, bad things that happen in life and how they are made manageable by having someone to go through it with. The beauty of these songs captivates the audience. Though more calm and even melancholy, the crowd stays enveloped by the sound.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In a sudden and clever change, the four-piece band retakes the stage and Japanese Breakfast breaks into their most popular song, &lsquo;Everybody Wants to Love You&rsquo;. Instantly the crowd is dancing again. As the closing song the band plays a more experimental track, &lsquo;Machinist&rsquo;. This song is about a woman falling in love with a robot. Though this song is more experimental, it is somehow the perfect way to end this other-worldly show. By the end of the show, those soft sounds from another planet have been brought firmly down to Earth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a fun and groovy show and the band&rsquo;s energy was high. Between song banter was kept brief, but not too brief as to prevent Zauner from telling jokes. These included trying out her best Scottish accent and informing us on the band&rsquo;s touring vices (simulated farming games for some and math for others). At some point in her jokes, Zauner seems to get embarrassed, wondering why she is sharing so much. She claims its because this is one of the first crowds on their European tour to laugh at her jokes. These funny, simple ramblings are enough to make the crowd laugh and the show just that more enjoyable. After each mini-introduction, the band goes directly back into their sonic trip.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;From the supporting bands, to the incredible talent of Japanese Breakfast, this show is one I am glad I did not miss.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 143, 1, '2017-11-10 17:33:19', '2017-11-10 18:47:29', 'japanese-breakfast-at-the-mash-house', 1, NULL, 1),

Almost immediately, a woman promoting Catholic Action hands me a free CD and pin. I get my drink and take a seat, waiting for the doors to open. It is past both of the advertised times when the doors finally open and we are let downstairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In a basement venue, the crowd waits for Catholic Action to take the stage. The crowd is uncharacteristically large for an opening band. Catholic Action is touring for their brand new album <em>In Memory Of</em>. Only weeks old, this album has threads of modern alternative music, but also something tantalizingly reminiscent of classic rock.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The band quickly enters the stage and kicks off the show. Instantly, their sound is loud and full of bass and drums. The vocals come through clear and well complimented by the music. Having only listened to the album, it is not until they announced their name a few songs into the show that I believed it was Catholic Action on stage. Where their album is radio ready, mixed and mastered with effects to create the more alternative sound, their live show sounds more like it has emerged from a garage. This unexpected sound is incredible. All of the aspects of the album that make you want to listen more are amplified when live. The alternative sound is dropped for a classic rock infused, punk vibe.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is obvious that the majority of the crowd has come to see Catholic Action. People are doing everything from calmly standing, to bobbing along, to full out dancing. After each song there is an eruption of cheers. A photographer circles the band, letting off a strobe light like effect with their flash. Expecting to see the stiff show of a new band, I am pleasantly surprised to be at a rowdy show of a band that has obviously accumulated a following. It could not have hurt that I was seeing them in their hometown.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The band plays the songs off their new album, also throwing in some unreleased tracks. Then they go into one of their singles, &lsquo;Black &amp; White&rsquo;. While listening to the album this song caught my attention but when played live it was overshadowed by the other songs of the night.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Catholic Action announces they are going to play their only slow song of the night. This song is not so much slow as it is just quieter than the others. In that light, it is still not very quiet. The band takes an purposefully long pause in the middle of the song. It is just long enough that the crowd seems unsure to respond. Then in unison the song kicks off again.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When Catholic Action informs us it is their last song, I realize how quick the set has passed. The band&rsquo;s sound had me enthralled and I could have listened for much longer. A few people in the crowd open up a mosh. The set ends on a high note.</span></p>\r\n', 143, 1, '2017-11-10 17:42:30', '2017-11-10 18:43:14', 'catholic-action-at-broadcast-glasgow', 1, NULL, 1),

Although centred around the idea of overcoming, the films took on a number of different forms, eschewing, or cheerfully overplaying, the triumphant tone that the theme can often produce. The night opened with <b>A Drowning Man</b>, a short film nominally concerned with the plight of refugees in Greece, but using the situation to peer into the life of its nameless protagonist, who is truly apart. The film benefits greatly from the cine-literate writer/director Mahdi Fliefel, and the keen eye of cinematographer Vasco Viana, who turns the open streets of Athens into a jungle for the protagonist to navigate. The introspective A Drowning Man was followed by the bombastic <b>Free Period</b>, the double entendre of which I must confess I failed to grasp until the film began. This crowdfunded production is wilfully over the top, and becomes a pastiche of westerns and exploitation films, giving a resolute edge to the often-ignored subject of menstruation and the cost of tampons. The Polish animation <b>The Escape</b> is a mixed bag, with excellent and provoking animation held back by the slow pace and seemingly unending darkness. I hope that the team behind this film give their animation style another try, perhaps with the addition of dialogue. <b>Haud Close to Me</b> is an interesting combination of film, ballet and spoken word that ran the risk of coming off as pretentious, but instead evoked the same feelings one of the better John Lewis Christmas adverts, short, utterly un-ironic, and well put together. <b>The Realm of Deepest Knowing</b> served as an antidote to The Escape, dealing with the tough subject matter in a hopeful and heartfelt way. I had the chance to talk with Seung-Hee Kim who wrote, directed, and animated the film, her second short, who pointed out that despite the film having no dialogue, it is based on a very Korean understanding of the interconnected soul and mind. The hand-drawn animations are charming, and the short is filled with colour and music, and communicate the personality of a work that comes from one person. <b>Jimbo </b>benefits from being a production by short film company Imaculado, and has been working through the short film circuit over the last few months. It is a well-acted and well shot Tarantino-esque picture that retains a clear grasp on the plot, and does well to place the viewer in medias res will quickly building a world and characters. That said, one cannot help but feel Jimbo is less subversive than it thinks it is. <b>Marky&rsquo;s Bad Week</b> takes the cake as the most twee film on show, using the old trope of a character who we expect to be dense or bumbling, and making him eloquent and relatable. That said Daniel Holmwood did a good job with this film, which was shot on location in Dublin, and Caolfhinn Dunne is eye catching as the yin to yang of the titular character. The evening closed with the German short <b>Nicole&rsquo;s Cage</b>, an unexpected combination of Terry Gilliam style dark-whimsy, light BDSM, and Cinematography from someone who has been watching too much Wes Anderson. The short is set on a giant ferris wheel that holds a number of flats, which provide the best view in the city, but also take around an hour to rotate to the bottom if the occupant wants to exit. In presenting the viewer with such an absurd scenario, Josef Brandl, who wrote and directed the film can have fun with the plot, which is by turns comic and dark. I hope to see more of his work in the future.</span></span></p>\r\n', 89, 1, '2017-11-14 14:52:50', '2017-11-14 14:52:50', 'edinburgh-short-films-festival-day-6', 3, NULL, 0),

In one and a half hours the play covers Anorexia, OCD, Depression and Anxiety &ndash; although other mental illnesses are also addressed. This is carried out through numerous monologues and duologues which are then split by a graphics played out on the white sheet backdrop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The design of <em>Mind-Full </em>is very simple and aims to focus on what is being said. The actors are dressed in black jeans and white t-shirts, with the set composed only of white sheets and a bench. There is little in the way of distractions making the words all the more powerful; the audience are forced to focus on what is being said. In true professional style, one actor was not even distracted by the man next to me who started having a coughing fit from his beer mid-monologue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play is verbatim, meaning all the monologues are transcribed word-for-word from real interviews with students from Edinburgh and beyond. The play takes extracts from the interviews conducted; Katrina has edited it to make a flowing piece of work in which all the interviews work in tandem with each other. This gives the play a real resonance, as it takes mental illnesses out of abstraction. I am impressed by the honesty of those who were willing to share their experiences and I hope it inspires others to recognise that mental health is not something to be endured in isolation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Mind-Full</em> cleverly informs the audience without patronising. For instance, it offers a deeper understanding of complex mental health disorders such as OCD, and how they can manifest themselves in various ways. I was particularly impacted by the realisation that I am a culprit of being insensitive to sufferers by using &lsquo;OCD&rsquo; as a jokey adjective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although <em>Mind-Full </em>does not hold much of a storyline due to its nature, it finishes with a message of outreach to those suffering, and their friends and family. It suggests some positive and negative reactions when discussing mental health, and potential steps one can take to help combat these illnesses. It seems to be a fitting end; leading a difficult subject &ndash; one which society often tries to ignore &ndash; into a more open discussion. <em>Mind-Full</em> provides the audience with room for much self-reflection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mind-Full continues its run at Assembly Roxy on the 19th and 20th November, 7pm.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n', 5, 1, '2017-11-19 16:32:50', '2017-11-19 16:34:16', 'mind-full-at-pleasance-theatre', 3, NULL, 1),

Bands are no less exposed to this experience than&nbsp;we are and this could lead us to a new age of music in which the borders between genres are dissolved altogether.&nbsp;Yonaka&#39;s sound&nbsp;can be seen as on the borderline of many genres. The&nbsp;Brighton-based band,&nbsp;not quite sure what to pin themselves down as, feel&nbsp;more comfortable to leave this decision to the fans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With&nbsp;Yonaka, the influences of various genres do not end with the sound of the music itself. At Sneaky Pete&rsquo;s the band bring in the energy of an old school hip-hop concert, while exerting heavy punk riffs to kick the energy into overdrive. Right from the get-go, Yonaka&nbsp;are ready to fire up the audience and it works. The&nbsp;likeability&nbsp;of each band member makes&nbsp;the crowd even more enthusiastic about the performance. Right from the first song, the lead singer Theresa&nbsp;Jarvis&nbsp;charms the&nbsp;audience and projects&nbsp;the energy she expects&nbsp;from the audience with her gestures and dances. Guitarists, George Edwards and Alex&nbsp;Crosby&nbsp;portray&nbsp;the typical&nbsp;demeanour&nbsp;of&nbsp;rockstars, swinging side to side with their hair all over the place.&nbsp;Crosby&nbsp;and Edwards look&nbsp;so focused it is as if&nbsp;they are&nbsp;battling to control their guitars. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The band starts by&nbsp;playing &#39;Run and Salty&#39;, the first song from the <em>HEAVY&nbsp;EP.</em>&nbsp;Yonaka&nbsp;never lets the energy die, jumping from one song to the next. The third song, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t&nbsp;Wanna&nbsp;Be&nbsp;Ya&rdquo; is one of the more emotional songs, especially for Theresa&nbsp;Jarvis. Even for a song as expressive as it is, the atmosphere does&nbsp;not dissipate for a moment. In the more serious moments of the song&nbsp;Jarvis&nbsp;approaches the edge of the stage, head in her lap, muttering the lyrics. The lights dim and the audience is given a breather to connect with the reflective mind of Theresa&nbsp;Jarvis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following &lsquo;WWBY, the transition to the next couple of songs is swift again. The second half is another mix of singles and music from the <em>HEAVY EP</em>. They go back and forth between their singles such as &#39;Drongo&#39;, &#39;Loner&#39; and &#39;Iggy&#39;, which are balanced out by &#39;Gods &amp; Lovers&#39;, &#39;Heavy&#39; and &#39;All In My Head&#39;. Yonaka amps up the crowd again, engaging the audience with the call and response commonly found in hip-hop concerts. Jarvis is centrestage feeding off the energy of the drummer Robert Mason consistently controlling the tempo and Crosby and Edwards supply&nbsp;that&nbsp;gritty style&nbsp;for which Yonaka is known. All members bounce and mnemonically sway&nbsp;to their fast paced music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The performance caps off with &lsquo;Bubblegum&rsquo;, one of the most popular songs from <em>HEAVY</em>. In &#39;Bubblegum&#39;, the entire energy culminates into the ultimate experience for the crowd. As the guitars blare and the drum pumps,&nbsp;Jarvis&nbsp;cries &ldquo;I, I, I, I, I/ I want it right now&rdquo;. Each repetition of the verse brings&nbsp;Jarvis&nbsp;a step closer to the edge of the stage, literally. Once the song reaches its climax, all hell breaks loose.&nbsp;Jarvis&nbsp;jumps in with the audience, handing over the microphone to the fans who eagerly sing along with her.&nbsp;Jarvis&nbsp;goes further and further into the crowd singing and dancing, engagement with the fans now at its peak. As the performance draws to a close, the guitars crescendo to usher in the end of the act.&nbsp;Yonaka&nbsp;sticks around for a drink after the performance and encourages the audience to stay. People line up to thank the band for their performance and to shower the band with praise. Some members of the crowd admit they had&nbsp;never heard of&nbsp;Yonaka&nbsp;until that night at Sneaky Pete&rsquo;s, but are&nbsp;fans by the end of the show. One couple had enjoyed&nbsp;Yonaka&rsquo;s&nbsp;performance in Glasgow so much, they drove to Edinburgh to see them again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The band strikes a resounding familiarity in its sound compared to their peers.&nbsp;Jarvis&nbsp;will have moments where she interpolates Gwen&nbsp;Stefani, but other times Wolf Alice. The sound coming from the instruments will make one think of Arctic Monkeys-&nbsp;a comparison the band are also familiar with. This does not make the band imposters by any means, as they certainly don&rsquo;t lose integrity in their sound. The interpolations are not necessarily deliberate and give the audience comfort with a&nbsp;recognisable, yet unique sound. In many ways,&nbsp;Yonaka&nbsp;are a composition of the best of all the aforementioned artists or bands. The future is certainly bright for this young band who have only been together for two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out their new&nbsp;EP,&nbsp; here:<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/4ZJhPsudePeA2takLeA2Ob\">YONAKA, HEAVY&nbsp;EP</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 142, 1, '2017-11-22 15:40:30', '2017-11-23 12:32:32', 'yonaka-at-sneaky-pete-s', 1, NULL, 1),

The noisy guitar fuzz reverberates around the small venue, accompanied by the headbanging of Hackman and her guitarist. Her songs are a little more brash than they were in&nbsp;<em>That Iron Taste</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>We Slept at Last</em>, the drums, bass and rhythm guitar punching through the audience as Hackman&rsquo;s siren-like voice begins to fill the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hackman&rsquo;s songs seem to always carry a hint of menace, at the very least. Even if it&rsquo;s only in the melody, there&rsquo;s a sense of danger hanging over her music. Her debut album could very well be used as a soundtrack for a horror film, and this character carries over to a few of the tracks on&nbsp;<em>I&rsquo;m Not Your Man</em>. Hackman&rsquo;s voice can be full of threat when the moment requires it, and she uses this talent to the fullest, staring down the crowd as her band thrash and yell along to the songs. The gig feels almost like it&rsquo;s as much a time for the band to go wild as it for the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hackman&rsquo;s set is short, but filled with well-chosen tracks. Along with songs from her last record, the&nbsp;shoegaze-like&nbsp;<em>I&rsquo;m&nbsp;</em><em>N</em><em>o</em><em>t Your Man</em>,&nbsp;Marika&nbsp;and her band play a few tracks from her previous albums, reworking them as&nbsp;grungier&nbsp;numbers. They&rsquo;re great additions to the&nbsp;setlist, showing the audience a new side to Hackman&rsquo;s older songs. &lsquo;Bath is Black&rsquo; swirls around the stage, filled with more energetic, less spectral electric guitars instead of the original acoustic instrumentation. It brings a moment of calm to the raucous set. Hackman also plays a bonus track from&nbsp;<em>I&rsquo;m Not Your Man</em>&nbsp;as well, &lsquo;Majesty&rsquo;, a slow, seductive song that thrums into your brain. The band keeps the audience in their grasp with these winding melodies just as they had with the bigger, more explosive numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crowd, though small, feels much larger with the amount of dancing that&rsquo;s going on. They reach a fever pitch towards the end of the show, during &lsquo;Boyfriend&rsquo;, the lead single from&nbsp;<em>I&rsquo;m Not Your Man</em>, a sarcastic needling of male insecurity and society&rsquo;s view of lesbian relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The show ends with &lsquo;My Lover Cindy&rsquo;, a song filled with braggadocio and lust, where Hackman shouts at the top of her lungs &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&nbsp;gonna&nbsp;get my fill / I&rsquo;m&nbsp;gonna&nbsp;keep my eyes on the prize and I&rsquo;ll suck you dry / I will&rdquo;, her voice filled with so much certainty that you&rsquo;re sure she&rsquo;ll get what she wants. As the band leaves the stage, we&rsquo;re left with a lasting warm feeling in our chests and grins on our faces. Hackman&rsquo;s a somewhat singular voice in the UK rock scene at the moment, and I wouldn&rsquo;t miss a show of hers, given the chance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 11, 1, '2017-11-23 17:20:46', '2017-11-23 19:06:28', 'marika-hackman-at-king-tut-s', 1, NULL, 1),

Every single person in that room is immediately touched by her music; her voice just creeps underneath everybody&rsquo;s skin, enough to induce goosebumps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About a third into the concert and several emotional minutes later, she plays &lsquo;Middle of the Bed&rsquo;. With those rhythmic guitar riffs supported by gentle drum beats one could be reminded of Katie Melua, which makes one wonder why this incredible artist isn&rsquo;t better known.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to Lucy Rose&rsquo;s undeniable talent, her band is also absolutely incredible. In particular, her bassist and backup singer: a 6&rsquo;6&rsquo;&rsquo; potential look-a-like for Dwayne &ldquo;The Rock&rdquo; Johnson, who probably eats what I eat in a week for breakfast but who sings in a falsetto voice that has the ability to make even the most hardened stoic cry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What else could make Lucy Rose even more likeable? Her sense of humour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joking throughout the entire evening and making a couple remarks about how her music is often described as too soft for a lot of people and not hesitating to make fun of herself, she has the entire crowd wrapped around her finger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Surprisingly, Lucy Rose appears to have a big fan base within the 60+ age group. That becomes apparent as she is talking about how only a few people would comment on her music with a phrase like &ldquo;I&nbsp;fucking&nbsp;love it&rdquo;, but at that point a man in his 60s (who happens to smell of whisky) comes up to me with the biggest smile and says, &ldquo;This is Mr.&nbsp;Fucking-Loves-It&rdquo; while pointing at himself. It was incredibly endearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before ending her concert with an encore, she revisits her earlier musical stages by singing &lsquo;Shiver&rsquo;, - which unfortunately is&nbsp;majorly&nbsp;interrupted by a drunk person stumbling down the stairs. This leads to a moment of sincerity. She admits to having come close to quitting writing songs recently, as she felt like nobody wanted to listen to her work. However, she explains she had a change of heart while going on tour in South America, because she felt &ldquo;that if there&rsquo;s even only one person that loves my music &ndash; it is worth making it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I most certainly had a lovely evening, and I hope this one person is enough.</p>\r\n', 29, 1, '2017-11-23 17:57:21', '2017-11-23 18:09:19', 'lucy-rose-at-the-caves', 1, NULL, 1);

Even people who have not seen it will recognise the song &lsquo;Brindisi&rsquo; immediately. </span>Verdi&rsquo;s heart-breaking opera about &lsquo;the fallen woman&rsquo;, meaning <i>La Traviata</i>, tells the story of a woman finding love, without expecting it. Merely to be thrown into a turmoil of emotions, honour, betrayals and misunderstandings. This up and down of emotions is <span style=\"font-weight:normal\">portrayed through astonishing music.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The beautiful courtesan Violetta has an exciting city life full of parties and several suiters, granting her a luxurious lifestyle. The young Alfredo Germont, from the countryside, has been in love for her since he has seen her for the first time and was checking up on her every day during her period of sickness without her noticing. Although Violetta does not want to fall in love and have an actual relationship with someone she cannot stop herself of falling for Alfredo after he devotes himself totally to her. Once they confess their love are happy and move away from their former party friends to a countryside estate. But money runs out and both try to handle it themselves without telling the other one. And while they try to sort out their life to stay together Alfredo&rsquo;s father shows up demanding the biggest sacrifice from Violetta, to leave Alfredo forever. A lot of broken hearts, misunderstandings, revenge attempts and horrible twists of fate are the basis of this emotional story perfect for an opera.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\">The Scottish Opera selected a talented cast that managed to fill their challenging roles perfectly. Especially, Gulnara Shafigullina, playing Violetta Valery, and Stephen Gadd, as Giorgio Germont, mesmerized the audience with their performance. It is the perfect combination of acting and singing skills that define the high standard.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\">The performance itself was done very traditionally, including the stage decoration and the costumes. No effort was taken in giving it a modern or new twist. This is a shame as the well-known opera and story would profit from at least a few small updates. Obviously, first time viewers might appreciate the traditional setting, which has been done beautifully, but this cast could have managed to take a risk and be a bit more experimental and creative.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\">All in all, this performance of <i>La Traviata</i> promises a great night out with excellent music and cast. In addition to this it offers a short trip back in time to a dramatic, fictional love story in France.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\">Verdi&rsquo;s gripping and heart-breaking opera<i> La Traviata</i>,<i> </i>full of twists and misunderstandings, will be performed at the Festival Theatre in Edinburgh:</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\">Wed 15, Sun 19, Tue 21, Thu 23 &amp; Sat 25 November, Evenings 7.15pm (not Sun) Matinee Sun 3pm. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\">For more details please take a look at http://www.edtheatres.com/latraviata.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\">It will be also performed in Glasgow at the Theatre Royal 28<sup>th</sup> November &ndash; 2<sup>nd</sup> December.

They have released several singles and two&nbsp;EPs&nbsp;in the past and are currently touring the UK.&nbsp;Nani&nbsp;Porenta&nbsp;sat down with them before their show at the Mash House in Edinburgh.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Your most recent single&nbsp;</b><b>&lsquo;Are you high?</b><b>&rsquo; was given the title of &ldquo;Hottest record in the world&rdquo; by Annie Mac for BBC 1. That&rsquo;s a title that&rsquo;s been given to artists like Beck, the Foo Fighters or Lana&nbsp;del&nbsp;Rey&nbsp;for example. Was that a milestone for you and how do you take stuff like that in?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Callum: It&rsquo;s a weird thing for it to be happening to us. I think we&rsquo;re just really grateful for it. I know obviously with those types of slots you have big labels who are pushing for those types of things. So, there is a lot of pressure on people at Radio to fill those slots with stuff. And it&rsquo;s amazing for us that Annie just gave it to us. The first time she gave it to us we were totally unsigned she had no reason to do it, except for the fact she liked us. We were super shocked, and it&rsquo;s obviously awesome for us. We weren&rsquo;t complaining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ewan: For us it&rsquo;s more like Annie&rsquo;s continued support of us, rather than the kudos of having it. Someone off their own back is just like &ldquo;I really like these guys and I want to support them&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Why bad sounds by the way?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ewan: It&rsquo;s a really boring story. We had this demo before we were a band, when we were just recording at home. We really like the song, but all the sounds just sucked, they were just really bad. So, we labelled that demo &lsquo;Bad sounds&rsquo;. Much, much later when we were trying to come up with a band name, we were just coming up with terrible, terrible names. We ended up ditching them all and just going back to the name of the first demo we worked on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I really like it now, at the time I was like &ldquo;Oh god, this is such a dreadful name&rdquo;. But the fact that it was the best out of that whole list, really says a lot about how bad that list was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>You have dropped some great stuff like your EPs&nbsp;<i>PHRESSSH</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mixtape One</i>&nbsp;and your current single&nbsp;</b><b>&lsquo;Are you high?</b><b>&rsquo;. Can we expect a debut album any time soon?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Callum: We&rsquo;re sort of writing with a view to an album at the minute, but we don&rsquo;t have any dates. We&rsquo;re not really setting it up as what it&rsquo;s going to be. We&rsquo;re just trying to write what feels right to as now and then hopefully it will form a cohesive thing. It&rsquo;s part of what&nbsp;<i>Mixtape One</i>&nbsp;was - this first go at trying to make the whole thing a cohesive piece of work and not just our ten most commercial sounding songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ewan:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s really important to us that whatever we put out as our debut album is a worthwhile piece of music as a whole. When we talk about our favourite albums a lot of them are artists&rsquo; debut album, when they&rsquo;re still trying out ideas, being brave and pushing boundaries. It&rsquo;s just a lot to be said about just really throwing your all into it. So, we&rsquo;re really keen not to jut whatever the next ten songs we write that will be the album, we don&rsquo;t want to do that. We want to write a whole bunch of songs and then choose which songs fit best together and then weave them into something that really works and flows well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Let&rsquo;s talk about song-writing a bit. What kind of process do you have?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ewan: It varies from song to song how it starts. &lsquo;Are you high?&rsquo; for example - we wrote just melodies [first], before we did anything else. It was really weird. I was watching something on TV and the adverts came on. I went and got a drink and hummed the melody and thought &ldquo;that&rsquo;s kind of cool&rdquo; and just recorded it on my phone. We then just build the whole song around it, which we&rsquo;ve never done before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And other times you just start with a beat, a little guitar riff or a piano lick &ndash; chords or whatever. There&rsquo;s not one way to writing a song. And if you feel like you&rsquo;ve found the formula to writing a song, you&rsquo;re just going to write the same song a lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Callum: I think we&rsquo;re still finding our way, still trying to learn from other people. Do a lot of interview watching and listening to music and trying to find new things we can try. The lyrics also comes from conversations and people we actually know, sort of trying to form it into what feels right in a song, that&rsquo;s normally what starts off the song &ndash; it&rsquo;s a line, and then join the dots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Then for example for&nbsp;</b><b>&lsquo;Zachariah</b><b>&rsquo; &ndash; how did the lyrics fit in that song?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Callum: I don&rsquo;t know, everybody always asks about this &lsquo;Zachariah&rsquo; thing &ndash; like &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Zachariah?&rdquo;. It was based mainly on one friend, but his name is not Zachariah. That line just sort of came straight when we had the beat &ndash; trying out that first melody, sometimes the first thing that comes just feels right &ndash; and for some reason it was that lyric and the phrasing of it. But the Michael Jackson influence is huge, that&rsquo;s probably our biggest collective influence. I think he was the first musician [Ewan and I] were both into. Probably the same for most people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Which of your songs would you say has the best story behind it?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ewan: My favourite in terms of stories is &lsquo;Avalanche&rsquo;, because there&rsquo;s three stories in one.&nbsp; Each verse is about a different person. I just really like the little tales within it, they&rsquo;re kind of open for interpretation. There&rsquo;s just something about it. And the &ldquo;Julie&rdquo; who&rsquo;s in verse two &ndash; when she first heard it she was like &ldquo;Is that about me?&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;Yeah it&rsquo;s a story you once told me one day at work&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s probably&nbsp;my favourite. That&rsquo;s where we found where we were comfortable writing lyrics and doing that sort of style just taking lines out of conversation with people and putting it into a song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Looking at your videos: The ET reference in&nbsp;</b><b>&lsquo;Living alone</b><b>&rsquo; or the Bruce Lee one for&nbsp;</b><b>&lsquo;Wages</b><b>&rsquo; &ndash; how did you come up with those ideas?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Callum: I didn&rsquo;t actually want to do a bad B-movie &ndash; I wanted to do a proper martial arts movie. I literally wanted to do a 100-grant budget [movie]. &nbsp;I remember sending our manager footage &ndash; chopped up from &ldquo;Crouching tiger hidden dragon&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;This would be the bomb &ndash; this is how we make it&rdquo;. That was obviously never going to happen, so we thought it would be funny to edit us on top of that stuff. Plus, we&rsquo;ve never been the band to be the moody cool band and we never wanted to be that band. So, we thought, if it makes us laugh and if we think it&rsquo;s cool &ndash; then let&rsquo;s just put it out and see what other people think.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ewan: A lot of the videos are just imagery that we like as well. Sometimes you have to tie a bit of a story line into it &ndash; like we tried with &lsquo;Living alone&rsquo;. But most of the time, like with the Kung Fu stuff &ndash; we really liked that aesthetic and it probably played a much bigger role in sort of our development than we realized &ndash; that whole scene &ndash; so we were pretty keen to play on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>A lot of people say your gigs are just a big party and you include the audience really well. How do you achieve that when being on stage?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ewan: I think it&rsquo;s just us&nbsp;vibing&nbsp;off what we do and just really enjoying the music that we&rsquo;re making. It helps that we&rsquo;re playing as five people that really get on. A lot of it has to do with the people who come to see us as well, when we can see that they&rsquo;re having a good time and we&rsquo;re having a good time &ndash; it&rsquo;s just this incredible cycle of good vibrations really.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Callum: Again, we don&rsquo;t want to be the moody cool band, so we never really take that stance to just stand up there, look cool and don&rsquo;t really do anything.

(63, 'Interview with the London Concertante ', '', '<p><em><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/67/content_stacks_image_340.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 226px;\" />The London Concertante Chamber Ensemble are performing in Edinburg</em><em>h this weekend at St. Giles Cathedral. As the name suggests, they&#39;re a group of musicians from London with a passion for Chamber music, they have travelled the globe with tours to the Middle East, USA, France, Finland and Spain. We spoke to Sean Morris to find out what the Ensemble are really like before their show.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You&rsquo;re performing in St. Giles cathedral, does performing in a cathedral change the acoustics of the concert?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Performing in Cathedral&rsquo;s is our usual gig. Sometimes we play in &lsquo;proper&rsquo; concert halls like Cadogan, Usher, or St. George&rsquo;s Halls, but it isn&rsquo;t our mainstay. Different cathedral&rsquo;s have different challenges though, particularly acoustically. Sometime the more aesthetically beautiful ones don&rsquo;t necessarily have the most handy acoustics! Luckily, St. Giles&rsquo;s has both. Its a very kind place to play, which means pretty much anywhere you sit it sounds great (it also means the sound carries further!). Sometimes buildings can be to dry where the sound doesn&rsquo;t carry, or too echoey so its difficult to hear the detail - particularly in fast passages - but St. Giles&rsquo;s is one of our favourite places to play because its so audience and player friendly!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your concert on the 1st and 2nd has a great student discount, I&rsquo;ve noticed this is becoming a trend at many classical music venues, I have attended a concert for as little as &pound;3. With the events looking more appealing to young people have you noticed a change in the composition of your audience?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have noticed a change in our audience, particularly in urban areas. The country side and more parochial places remain somewhat a challenge however, but that is perhaps because they have an older demographic!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think classical music is having to change and reach out to a younger audience in a different way. Not necessarily because it&#39;s less attractive musically than other forms of music, but perhaps because it retains an heir of elitism and expensiveness (something that stems more from the opera house than the concert hall I think). Young people have less money and more worries than say 30 years ago, especially when the current government seems to be putting seemingly ever increasing economic pressure and responsibility on the youth even once they&rsquo;ve left school! So Classical Music as a whole has to adapt to a shifting market - we need an audience, but also play this music because we, like any artist, believe in it and want to share it. The sad thing is that the more cuts that are made to the arts, the more reliant even large orchestras become on public funding and tickets.. but we try where we can. We want everyone to love this music and we need to make it accessible without targeting just one economic class or generation of people!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is there still more that could be done to change the composition of your audience?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think this leads on from my previous answer. There is still work to be done. The average age of our audience tends to be between 30-50, i.e. people that have perhaps found their feet economically, thinking about or have a family etc. But we remember what it was like to be young. While we&rsquo;re not naive enough to think all young people would come if tickets were just &pound;2 (one&rsquo;s basic musical taste obviously has a role to play!), but we do think if you come along you&rsquo;ll enjoy it. We have begun this student ticket scheme fairly recently, and have plans in the future for further outreach and perhaps even bigger more regular discounts at large venues like St.Giles&rsquo;s or Cadogan Hall in London.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Education if the best way to tackle change and progression in such an issue as addressing the perception of classical music from those under 21, but the best way to get them in firstly is to be down to earth and start lowering prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If you could include any non-classical instrument into your chamber ensemble what would it be?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hmmm&hellip; well sometimes we&rsquo;ve had an accordion in quite regularly a few years ago to play some Tango! (Chris the musical director has a big thing for Latin American music). Personally I&rsquo;d enjoy an electric guitar and bass playing through some Bach cello suites (but I think thats been done on youtube somewhere already!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you have any opportunities for younger people to get involved with the London Concertante?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the ticket prices, this year we have opened an initiative for young film/media and sound engineering students to record and edit our concerts. For a number of years we have received many requests from uni students looking for professional quality musicians for their coursework and this year thought we&rsquo;d make a thing of it. Apparently classical music offers different challenges to most music, so we&rsquo;re happy to help! Several times a year we visit primary schools in our local area in London and do &lsquo;introductions to music&rsquo; and fun workshops and the like. In terms of more developed musicians in their late teens we have plans in place for rehearsal days and chamber music masterclasses from 2018 onwards, which you&rsquo;ll probably see come to life during our planned Seven Sins of Tango project next year!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>When you are not rehearsing what music would you prefer to listen to; classical or contemporary?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personally, I listen to all sorts when I&rsquo;m away from rehearsals. Mostly its bebop jazz, big band crooners or Hip Hop. Our MD loves a bit of Latin America and Laura Marling, and our soloist for the evening at St. Giles&rsquo;s, Ben Norris, has a MASSIVE thing for 90&rsquo;s pop and Whitney Houston ballads! I&rsquo;m not sure you&rsquo;d catch many of us listening to classical music on our phones or iPods walking around!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You&rsquo;ve performed at some festivals and clubs- is this a very different experience to that of your more common venues like St. Martin-in-the-Fields?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think performing is the same wherever you go, just with some slight variations. But Festivals are always exciting, the audience is always a bit more raucous and loud in their appreciation. I&rsquo;ve never been a big fan of sitting silently for ages and waiting 25/30 mins to clap. If you like it, show it, and if you have a drink in your hand, all the better! Maybe its why live jazz is sometimes more appealing as a social occasion.. !&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The London Concertante will be&nbsp;performing on the&nbsp;1st and 2nd December in St. Gile&rsquo;s Cathedral, Edinburgh.</strong></p>\r\n', 145, 1, '2017-11-29 21:41:09', '2017-12-01 12:57:45', 'interview-with-the-london-concertante', 3, NULL, 0),

Poor Sam.

Flyte is the name of a charming, outwardly carefree but seriously messed up posh boy and wants to know if this an influence for naming the band)</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: Good segway from Cake Sam into Brideshead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>AS: Thank you.</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>S: It&rsquo;s quite a lot to read a whole novel for an interview with a band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: But you&rsquo;re an English Lit student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: Yes. How do you know that? <em>(Ally remembers that she is wearing thick glasses and knitwear)</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>S: You mentioned you read English. We didn&rsquo;t know it was literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: Well I assumed. All of our fans are English Literature students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: Are they? Because it&rsquo;s lyrical?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: I don&rsquo;t know why but every single fucking one of them studies English Literature <em>(he laughs)</em>.&nbsp;My parents are English teachers so maybe that&rsquo;s something to do with it. But the demographic seems to be very consistently students and predominantly Literature students, which I like; it makes me feel good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: Do you all write?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: Yes, we all write everything equally. I write the words but other than that the music is spookily four ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: Do you have writing sessions? How do you do it?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: We do. Never more than the four of us, I&rsquo;d say. The four of us can work together in a musical capacity but I think if you want to work with words it can&rsquo;t be more than groups of two.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: It&rsquo;s harder to be vulnerable, maybe.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: Maybe it is - I was about to say it&rsquo;s too much committeeing of creative ideas but it&rsquo;s probably a lot to do with that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: So do the harmonies come early?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: Not necessarily. We do like to build songs in that traditional way of having a song well written in its base form. Then whatever you do to the song is going to enhance it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: Do you sing everything around one mic when you record it?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: The three of them sing their stuff round one mic and I do the lead vocal on a separate one. The process is quite fun -</p>\r\n\r\n<p>N: Fun is a strong word. <em>(They all laugh. Has clearly at times been Not Fun.)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: Fun for me, not for them. I get to sit between the two speakers and listen to the physical outcome of where they&rsquo;re all stood. So if Nick&rsquo;s stood too close or the vowel sound isn&#39;t quite right. There are tiny little nuances that make the vocal blend exactly right and it&rsquo;s completely wrong until it&rsquo;s right. So that&rsquo;s really fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: Do you find that your songs transform a lot as you build on them?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: Yeah, of course. The myth is that a song&rsquo;s a song. A song can be good or bad depending on how the arrangement is executed. We&rsquo;ve had a lot of songs that I think are great in their base form and we&rsquo;ve pretty much slaughtered them by giving them the wrong arrangement, and it can be down to one tiny little thing. The minute you bring drums into it, for instance, that completely shapes and defines a song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS to J: Do you stick to the classic kit, or do you use all sorts of weird things when you&rsquo;re recording?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>J: I used a sponge at one point. I&rsquo;ve used various different pieces of cleaning equipment to make sounds on my snare drum but I do stick to a normal kit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>WILL stands, whispers something, and leaves. &ldquo;Did he say he&rsquo;s going for a poo?&rdquo;, &ldquo;No, I think it was pop to the loo&rdquo;. Shame. Would have been quite the exit.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Encouraged by 3/4 of the band I am to write: interview holds. WILL pops for a poo.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: Do you have a favourite song to perform?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>S: I think &lsquo;Cathy Come Home&rsquo;, probably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: Is that because it gets people going?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>S: It&rsquo;s a very dynamic arrangement, with lots of tempo changes and instrument changes so it&rsquo;s good fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>J: It&rsquo;s a bit of a singalong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>N: I think unanimously it&rsquo;s our favourite. It&rsquo;s really easy to fuck it up, which makes it exciting each night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: Do you find performing them that the songs end up changing shape - i.e. they&rsquo;re not what they are in the studio?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>S: No, because in the studio we play them more or less live, so they&rsquo;re basically exactly like they are in recording.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: What did you think of the set? You know the record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: I loved it. It was like listening to the album. It sounded clean.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>S: In a good way?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: In a good way. Nick Mulvey played Edinburgh last month and his audience had a similar stillness to yours tonight. Everyone was really drinking it in as you played.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: I think it&rsquo;s beginning to be a bit old fashioned, the idea that you have to be jumping around in an audience to show appreciation - or moving at all. Techno and EDM redefined it so that the audience was the performer and the music was there to serve the audience. But with this kind of music it&rsquo;s not that at all really, is it, you&rsquo;re there to watch people on stage doing all the work. It hasn&#39;t changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: Are you trying to nod back to the 60s and 70s?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>S: Not intentionally, no. We just do because that&rsquo;s the stuff we like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>N: We have a broad taste though.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: We&rsquo;re listening to a whole range of things. I wouldn&rsquo;t want people to think we&rsquo;re just sat there listening to the The Beatles all day long.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>N: Or trying to emulate them in any way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: The thing about the Beatles is that as songwriters we started off listening to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: They could do melody.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: Exactly and you can&rsquo;t really escape that as an influence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>N: With the arrangements we&rsquo;ve tried to be a little more original.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: Or just timeless. Four voices round a mic isn&rsquo;t old school and it&rsquo;s not modern either. The hope is that it&rsquo;s timeless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: Were you in choirs?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>J: Will and I were in a choir for a couple of years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: Nick and I first met when we were really young children doing a Gilbert and Sullivan community children&rsquo;s musical thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: Rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll. How young were you when you met?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>N: I was about ten.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: So I was about nine. Jon and I were also at school together.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: So when did you know there was going to be a band?&nbsp;Always?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: When did we meet, seven? I&rsquo;d say eight and a half: band. Even then I remember a band with a couple of mates and I was on clarinet. Jon was playing drums. And some guy was on the classical guitar like that kid in School of Rock. Sam joined us when we were quite far down the line of being in shit bands, trying things, throwing them in the bin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>J: Nick&rsquo;s taken offence at that. He wants to say &lsquo;speak for yourself&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t you Nick?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>N:&nbsp;<em>(laughs)</em>&nbsp;I was in different bands until these guys; I knew them though, and so when they moved to London I joined the band -&nbsp;&nbsp;a couple of years ago - then we met Sam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: So if you were in lots of &lsquo;shit bands&rsquo; when did this band manage to -</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: To not be shit anymore?&nbsp;<em>(laughs)</em>&nbsp;It was kind of a constant, continuous build towards where we ended up. Jon and I were always in bands with members coming and going, building what we were and what we wanted. Writing the shit songs is it, I think. You have to write lots of bad songs to get them out the way until you get to the good ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: Where did you record this album?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: In Australia, funnily enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: How did that happen?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: <em>(laughs)</em>&nbsp;We were producing a track ourselves in London called&nbsp;Please Eloise&nbsp;and we weren&rsquo;t really getting the mix right. It was all recorded but the end sound was wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were fed up. Then we heard Courtney Barnett, she&rsquo;s an Australian artist with a storytelling kind of vocal which is really good and a similar sound to what we were going for with&nbsp;PE.&nbsp;The record company tracked the producer down; he was an&nbsp;indie&nbsp;producer in the middle of nowhere in Australia and he did an amazing job. So when it came to making the album we went to work with him out there, because once you&rsquo;ve got the flight over you may as well be there for six weeks!.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: When do you think you&rsquo;ll do a second album?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>S: Well we&rsquo;re working on it now, so it&rsquo;ll be out next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: Do you think it&rsquo;ll have a different kind of sound?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: We were having this discussion earlier actually. I think it wants to be an extension and evolution from what we&rsquo;ve just done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: Did you ever sit down and have a conversation about what you wanted the album to be?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>S: Not really. There wasn&rsquo;t a blueprint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>N: We&rsquo;re quite prone to just going off in a million directions which is why it took so long to form an album. When we got into the studio it started taking shape slowly but then when it finally happened - it was actually after we&rsquo;d started mixing it - it was like&nbsp;okay, this is the record. We understand it now.&nbsp;It was after that we understood it, not during the process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: It&rsquo;s hell, basically, in the studio. It&rsquo;s like dipping your head under water and going &lsquo;I wonder when and how I&rsquo;m going to get my head back out of this&rsquo;. You&rsquo;re completely bemused as to how it&rsquo;s all going to end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>S: I quite enjoyed it, contrary to what he&rsquo;s saying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>NICK walks to the fridge. JON, who has been very quiet until now, finds his voice: (stage whisper) Nick! Can I have a beer?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: It must be quite exhausting.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: Yeah absolutely, it is a bit of a marathon making an album.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: How do you know when an album is done?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: When someone says they aren&#39;t paying for it anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>N: <em>(laughs)</em>&nbsp;Yeah, then you&rsquo;re done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: No, we knew when it was finished, we had the ten tracks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>S: We could have done more. We finished mixing at 4am and we had a flight in a few hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>J: We finished as we were jumping in the car,&nbsp;handing over the&nbsp;USB&nbsp;stick. We knew we wanted it to be ten tracks, very&nbsp;OCD&nbsp;of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>W: It&rsquo;s never finished is it? Everyone has that when they&rsquo;re making something, you always could be happier with it. But it&rsquo;s that nice moment where a little bit of time passes and you haven&rsquo;t heard it in a while and you hear it - I had that the other day. I listened to to it in the car from start to finish. It was like&nbsp;yeah, I&rsquo;m really proud of this, but it was the first time in a long time I&rsquo;d enjoyed it&nbsp;<em>(laughs).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AS: On that note, leaving this conversation a little unfinished, I will let you be free.

Amelia&rsquo;s soulful lyrics and indie melodies pair terrifically with the restless electronic beats Nick creates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pair begins the night with the song &ldquo;Sound&rdquo;, the opener from their sophomore and most recent album, What Now. &ldquo;Sound&rdquo; starts out with a crackling sound, like a vinyl being put on a record player. The same verse repeats over and over again, going from a distorted hum to Amelia&rsquo;s voice singing loud and clearly. It is not until this point that Amelia joins Nick onstage. Choosing this song, which is not characteristic of their generally spirited and energetic music, is a surprising but perfect choice that sets the tone for the rest of the show, mainly because it forces the buzzing crowd to quiet down and listen. It&rsquo;s easy to just party and dance to Sylvan Esso&rsquo;s music, but &ldquo;Sound&rdquo; reminds the audience that their songs have beautiful lyrics that deserve just as much attention as the high-powered rhythms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That being said, Sylvan Esso&rsquo;s live show is a party, and Nick and Amelia like it that way. Amelia spends most of the show sliding around on giant platform shoes that make her at least 6 inches taller than she actually is. During the instrumental breaks, she moves her body to the pulsing of the music, enjoying Nick&rsquo;s performance just as much as the audience is. Her exuberant movement around the stage encourages her listeners to let go, have fun, and embrace the unique experience of seeing music live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sylvan Esso ends their performance with &ldquo;Radio&rdquo;, a biting sendup of the music industry that reminds me once again of how their songs can be entertaining while still carrying a progressive message. &ldquo;Radio&rdquo; is exactly three minutes and 30 seconds long, the length mainstream radio stations prefer, and comments on how hard it can be, for women especially, to break into the music industry. At the same time, it is Sylvan Esso&rsquo;s most pop record, and it is the perfect danceable track to end the show on. Because at the end of the day, Nick and Amelia just want you to have the time of your life. I certainly did.</p>\r\n', 136, 1, '2017-12-01 18:35:08', '2017-12-01 20:37:45', 'sylvan-esso-at-swg3-glasgow', 1, NULL, 1),

She begins her show at Glasgow&rsquo;s Art School backlit, bathed in blue light. Sitting alone onstage with just a guitar, she does nothing, says nothing, until the crowd finish clapping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her hour-long set begins with the final song from Party, her latest album. When sung in her low warbling contralto, the lyrics to &lsquo;Swell Does the Skull&rsquo; sound as if they are in a different language. With exception is the line &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be a sinner&rdquo;, which rings out clearly through the venue, giving the song a sense of urgency, as if she is pleading with the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A keyboard player comes onstage for the next song; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m So Sorry&rsquo;. The piano adds little to the already bare-bones melody which is carried wholly by the power of Harding&rsquo;s voice. She hugs the guitar close to her chest, her chin resting on its shoulder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most fascinating aspects of seeing Aldous Harding perform live is how she uses body language. Her face contorts with weird facial expressions, almost like she is trying to communicate the song&rsquo;s emotion without language. She stares into the audience, nodding and grimacing and with eyes bulging like a boxer who is trying to psych out their opponent before a match. When she later sings &lsquo;What If Birds Aren&rsquo;t Singing They&rsquo;re Screaming?&rsquo;, her expressions paired with the unnerving lyrics- evoke the feeling that she is a malevolent narrator trying to frighten children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHR3uEOkkSo\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although she moves little during the beginning of the set, she stands for &lsquo;Blend&rsquo; and again waits for the room to fall silent before beginning. She bobs along with the music, occasionally inserting arrhythmic dance movements, punctuated by small gestures that are not unlike a subdued version of Mick Jagger&rsquo;s notorious strut. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She gradually works through a number of songs from Party and plays &lsquo;Elation&rsquo;- a new release- in which she eases the audience into the story with sweet vocals but then shocks them by bellowing the chorus. In some ways,&nbsp;Aldous&nbsp;Harding&nbsp;is a typical folk singer. Her songs are stories and poems, backed up by simple guitar melodies and her commanding voice but there remains something new and unnerving about her style of singing and performing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to imagine&nbsp;Aldous&nbsp;Harding&nbsp;in a supermarket, or at home, or indeed any place other than the stage. Her&nbsp;theremin-like&nbsp;voice, which serenades us for her final song &lsquo;Horizon&rsquo;, almost makes us believe that she&rsquo;s from another planet. This isn&rsquo;t for lack of&nbsp;relatability-&nbsp;the lyrics to &lsquo;Horizon&rsquo; speak about saying <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2017/05/19/529105358/the-story-of-aldous-hardings-party-track-by-track\">&ldquo;Good-bye &mdash; and not necessarily for any reason at all other than... I&#39;ve got to go. I&#39;m showing that person two things; their life, and their life with me. And I&#39;m taking one of them away. And that&#39;s me.&rdquo;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With &lsquo;Horizon&rsquo; she says goodbye to the audience, and we are left contemplating a life without her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 17, 1, '2017-12-02 11:58:56', '2017-12-02 11:58:56', 'aldous-harding-at-glasgow-s-art-school', 1, NULL, 1);

', '<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/74/content_IMG_20171128_212905.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I eagerly anticipated&nbsp;Kllo&rsquo;s&nbsp;show at Sneaky Pete&rsquo;s on 28 November. Having been introduced to the band mere weeks ago, it seemed like fate that they were coming to Edinburgh.&nbsp;Kllo&nbsp;has been on a whirlwind international tour to promote their new album,&nbsp;<i>Backwater</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To begin, since Sneaky Pete&rsquo;s is a small, intimate venue, the cousin-duo of&nbsp;Kllo, Simon and&nbsp;Chloe, make their way from the back of the crowd to the stage to set up their equipment. We are given a few seconds of darkness before they begin their show with a performance of &lsquo;Downfall.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simon is left in shadow manning the mixers while&nbsp;Chloe&nbsp;switches off between vocals and the pad controller. One neat aspect of the show is seeing them mix the music live. Their performance of &lsquo;By Your Side&rsquo; highlights this.&nbsp;Chloe&nbsp;sings the first line &ldquo;just&nbsp;wanna&nbsp;be by your side, again&rdquo; and both proceed to mix the line with the rest of the instrumental on stage. This makes each show unique, and tailor-made for the audience. You get to witness the creation of the song right before your eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kllo then performs &lsquo;Making Distractions,&rsquo; my favorite song off&nbsp;<i>Backwater</i>. Here, Chloe steps to the front of the stage to sing. She is silhouetted by the lights behind her and she feels so close to us. I am near the front and can almost see the shine of the whites of her eyes in the darkness. Combined with her breathy, ghostly vocals, it has a haunting, yet dreamlike effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kllo breaks up the chilled-out vibe of the show with an absolute banger of performance of &lsquo;Virtue.&rsquo; The lights, which have been relatively tame up until now, go up to full flashing lights. Simultaneously, the crowd which has been slightly swaying to the music, busts out into dance. It is the peak of the show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The show concludes with more mellow performances of songs off&nbsp;<i>Backwater</i>&nbsp;and &lsquo;Bolide,&rsquo; off&nbsp;<i>Well-Worn</i>. Considering the high energy performance of &lsquo;Virtue&rsquo;, this transition is rather jarring. This effect does not fully work and ends the show on a slightly unsatisfying note.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite this, the crowd is calling for an encore with &ldquo;one more tune, one more tune.&rdquo; A particularly bold crowd member calls for &ldquo;three more tunes!&rdquo;&nbsp;Chloe&nbsp;smiles, and sheepishly offers, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a piano ballad for you. It&rsquo;s one of our favorites. Would you like to hear it?&rdquo; The crowd crows its approval and we are treated to a performance of &lsquo;Nylon.&rsquo; The lights shut off then, and the show concludes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chloe&nbsp;and Simon hang around the venue after the show and I chat with them about their music and where they are headed next (Leeds). I tell&nbsp;Chloe&nbsp;that my friend compared her vocals with that of Little Dragon and she gives me a beaming smile. &ldquo;I love Little Dragon. I love&nbsp;Yukimi. She is queen.&rdquo; It is always reassuring when an artist you like is just as personable and enjoyable as their music. Fortunately, the show was just as enjoyable as well.</p>\r\n', 52, 1, '2017-12-04 19:50:26', '2017-12-04 19:50:26', 'kllo-at-sneaky-pete-s', 1, NULL, 0),
(69, 'The Tin Soldier - A Perfect Christmas Theatre Treat for the Whole Family', '', '<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"color:black\">The Tin Soldier by the Birds of Paradise Theatre Company is an exciting, unpredictable, very entertaining but also critical play. It was obviously based on the romantic fairy tail by Hans Christian Andersen, which focuses on several dolls and other toys in the possession of a young, fortunate and rich boy. Specifically, it is the story about a steadfast tin soldier with only one leg. He is in love with a beautiful ballerina who is only standing on one leg as she is in a constant dancing pose. Therefore, the tin soldier thinks that the ballerina is just like him, incomplete, out of the norm. On day this soldier gets thrown away by the boy and has a long journey ahead of him while trying to find a way back to his true love.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"color:black\">The Birds of Paradise Theatre Company took Andersen&rsquo;s original story and put it in a different setting told by a kid that is also an outsider due to a disability and who tells the story of the tin soldier while he is telling his own story of how he started liking this fairy tail although he used to hate it at first. So, this way the story is told by another outsider which is out of the norm, not completely accepted by society. A boy, who tells his own problems through the tin soldier as they reflect each other&rsquo;s outsider positions, shortcomings and troubles. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"color:black\">In the play other social criticism is portrayed in a very well way for kids to understand but also touching and gripping for the grownups. All of this is put into a nice play with original music which is performed live. With and addition of sign language throughout the play so everyone can understand what is going on. Also, the whole text is portrayed on a screen during the show and, therefore, this piece can be heard, seen and read, experienced through several senses. This play includes not only a wider audience with this kind of performance but also wider range of actors. It is an integrative play which is performed by people from different backgrounds for people with all sorts of backgrounds.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"color:black\">The story is very gripping, sweet and sad. The actors play very well and it is definitely a show to be recommended to young and old as it is fun but also educating. Especially, perfect to watch during the holidays. It is heart-warming but also a reflection of our society and the problems that we face. And I think, if this would be the way we tell fairy tails and stories from now on, maybe, in the future we will deal with our problems better, and probably wouldn&rsquo;t even have these problems. Because we would most likely try to work together more, include everyone to make a better future for all of us.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">This performance can still be seen until Christmas at <strong><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\"><a href=\"http://www.edtheatres.com/studio\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\">The Studio</span></span></a>: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\">Thurs 7 - Sat 23 December, Evenings 7pm (not Sun or Mon) Matinees 2pm Thu 14, Fri 15, Wed 20, Thu 21, Fri 22 and Sat 23 December</span></span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"color:black\">For details please see the official homepage: <u>http://www.edtheatres.com/thetinsoldier</u></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"color:black\">And for more information about the Birds of Paradise Theatre Company have a look at: <u>http://www.boptheatre.co.uk/tin-soldier/</u></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 146, 1, '2017-12-15 22:00:41', '2017-12-15 22:01:38', 'the-tin-soldier-a-perfect-christmas-theatre-treat-for-the-whole-family', 3, NULL, 0),

It&rsquo;s a very powerful illustration of the rhetoric these pioneering women were contending with. It is absurd to the point of comedy that women were denied an education in case it interfered with their ability to have children, but as the story of these girls unfolds it&rsquo;s obvious that it was no laughing matter.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">We are introduced to the girls, Tess, Carolyn, Celia and Maeve on their first day at Girton. They are thrilled to be given the opportunity of an education, but aware of the prejudices that they will face. As part of their first science lesson, their teacher Mr Banks (Callum Pope) teaches them to ride a bicycle. The male students don&rsquo;t believe their friend Edwards who claims to have seen a woman on a bike, saying it&rsquo;s impossible as women &lsquo;aren&rsquo;t allowed&rsquo;. Shockingly restrictive as this is, this is the boys&rsquo; attitude towards the presence of women at Cambridge and their amusement turns to more violent resistance as the play goes on. Ed Campbell really shone as Edwards, the fall guy of the boys group. His comic timing was perfect, and he was quietly hilarious without overdoing it. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">As they begin their classes, they are met with enthusiasm from some teachers. Miss Blake (Heather Daniell), is passionate about fighting for the girls&rsquo; right to graduate and for the suffrage movement. She inspires the girls and pushes them to match their male counterparts grade for grade. Ultimately, their support for the girls costs both Miss Blake and Mr Banks their careers, such was the strength of feeling against them.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">Each scene was titled, the titles appearing on a screen above the stage between scenes. This made the play seem like a series of vignettes, which worked well. It seemed natural to be dropping in on these characters at various points over the course of their year. However, the scene changes were often slow, and this made the run time of over two hours a little hard to bear in Bedlam&rsquo;s less than ambient temperatures. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">Blue Stockings confronts the audience with issues which in the UK today seem laughable.

Not that he doesn&rsquo;t already have the look, moves or talent of a rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll heavyweight, but rather he comes across as a man of the people despite the fact that his schtick is pretending to be a lecherous hack. Here, in Glasgow&rsquo;s Mono, the intimate vegan cafe-cum-venue, he is about to serve up a platter of synth-driven pop with a healthy portion of dad dancing. He doesn&rsquo;t shy away from interacting with the crowd- even before the show. He works his way from the green room to the stage, hugging friends and shaking hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Part of Alex Cameron&rsquo;s charm is his washed-up Hollywood entertainer bit. <em>Forced Witness</em>, his latest album, is artfully sleazy. This sleaze is revealed throughout the show by the band, who happen to look as if they have all stumbled out of a casino that night. Fan-favourite Roy Molloy is on saxophone and indie-pop chanteuse Holiday Sidewinder provides backing synth. As the show opens with &lsquo;Happy Ending&rsquo; from Cameron&rsquo;s 2013 debut, <em>Jumping the Shark</em>, Roy, Holiday and the rest of the band bop along disaffectedly to the pared back synth and drum beat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As disaffected as the backing band appear, Alex Cameron can&rsquo;t contain his excitement. He busts moves during each song, threading the mic&rsquo;s cable through his hands and adopting a rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll stance. Noting the sizeable crowd, he says &ldquo;we used to play to 5 or 6 people in a basement, so this is a beautiful thing&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The enthusiasm shown by the crowd is reciprocated by the band. In an ongoing meme for this tour, Roy rates the footstool he is given by the venue (3.5/5). Introducing the song &lsquo;Candy May&rsquo;, Cameron says &ldquo;I wrote this song as a love song and I played it to the girl it&rsquo;s for and she started crying, and I realised it&rsquo;s a breakup song&rdquo; and the crowd laughs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The song, &lsquo;Real Bad Looking&rsquo;, sounds like telephone hold music with a darker side to the lyrics. Sung from two perspectives- a woman and a man, at the same bar- their personalities are betrayed by lines like &ldquo;I am the goddamn drunkest, ugliest girl at the bar/ Yeah who the hell are you to tell me that I can&#39;t leave my kid in the car&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On-stage Alex Cameron comes across as likeable, even as he dons detestable characters through song. Although fans know that Cameron&rsquo;s persona is just a character, it appears problematic in how quick the audience is to join in and sing along- particularly with &lsquo;Marlon Brando&rsquo; in which the song&rsquo;s cowardly protagonist says &ldquo;So I&#39;ll tell you something sister, I&#39;m feeling mighty fine / You tell that little faggot call me faggot one more time&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This particular song, however, comes with a disclaimer from Cameron. He ensures that everyone is aware that the &ldquo;confused straight white male&rdquo; character is just a character, saying &ldquo;as long as everyone is staying hydrated and being respectful, then we&rsquo;re satisfied&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Highlights of the show include a more upbeat &lsquo;Strangers Kiss&rsquo;, Roy&rsquo;s saxophone solo in &lsquo;Running Out of Luck&rsquo; (which met significant cheers from the crowd), and &lsquo;The Chihuaha&rsquo;, an electro-pop bop similar in sound to bands like Hot Chip and Metronomy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Alex Cameron and band know how to please their audience and if they continue this trajectory of increasing popularity, it won&rsquo;t be long before these Australians are back in the UK playing to even bigger crowds and rating even better footstools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 17, 1, '2018-01-06 17:29:04', '2018-01-06 17:29:29', 'alex-cameron-at-mono-glasgow', 1, 89, 1),

Have you tried it?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nick: No.&nbsp; It grows in South America so maybe one day we&rsquo;ll try it but they look cool and it&rsquo;s kind of nice being named after a fruit I suppose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>FA: Who have been your biggest musical influences?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nick:&nbsp; As a band I suppose there&rsquo;s a huge list, not that we sound like any of them but there&rsquo;s stuff that we all enjoy and have been inspired by.&nbsp; Nick Cave and a lot of electronic stuff like Aphex Twin and Radiohead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>FA: It might have been one you&rsquo;ve already mentioned but if you could record a song with any band or artist who would you pick?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nick:&nbsp; Maybe it would be good to do something really unlikely - like an electronic collaboration with - actually no that would be horrible!

The festival tours 600 countries, having showings on all seven continents.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">The showing in Edinburgh this year took place on Saturday the 13th of January. In the festival theatre a crowd assembled, complexions glowing and sinews straining from aspirational training, gore text jackets for all-weathers, pertex puffas for ice climbing, and spandex blended jeans for rock climbing. Energy bars were dished out from the sponsors along with groovy outdoor lifestyle stickers for estate car roof boxes. Let the Banff Mountain Film Festival begin.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">First up &lsquo;Imagination&rsquo;, a film featuring Tom Wallisch a professional freeskier, runs on the premise of a little boy&rsquo;s imagination of ski stunts in the surrounding landscape as he&rsquo;s driven to school by his parents. The parents sit in the front arguing and discussing bathroom tiles at length, whilst the boy dreams of a freestyle skier outside the car and hey presto Tom Wallisch is leaping and spinning from house to house, trashing his skis clearing roads and railings. As the family reach the school Tom Wallisch is joined by countless skiers from the imaginations of the other children. The short film is endearing and humorous with some beautiful shots of Nelson, BC, Canada, it won &lsquo;Best Snowsports Film&rsquo; in the festival. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Next up we see &lsquo;Edges&rsquo; a film about the life of Yvonne Dowlen a 90-year old world class ice skater. Yvonne, who walks with difficulty manages to hold grace and agility once on the ice, she claims skating is easier than walking for her. She tells the camera that we need not abandon our passions, hobbies and pastimes as we get older and as if to prove the point as the film ends there is a postscript saying, &ldquo;She died as she lived, on the ice -2016&rdquo;. A collective emotional swallowing throughout the audience.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Following this emotional clip is a film, &lsquo;Intersection&rsquo;, about a mountain biker/artist, Micayla Gatto, who combines her passion for mountain landscapes through her two jobs. &nbsp;The film is a supremo, its fast, its furious, its five minutes with riffy rock guitars and badass drums. The landscapes and their pictorial paintings are stunning. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">The next film, a cracking one, &lsquo;Into Twin Galaxies&rsquo;, follows the National Geographic Adventurers of the year Ben Stookesberry, Sarah McNair-Landry and Erik Boomer as they travel across Greenland by foot, ski, kite ski and kayak. The trio adored in very attractive outdoor clothing embark on a 1000km trip to reach the northern-most un-kayaked river. Well it&rsquo;s not without hitch, the trio have relied on google earth for an assessment of the terrain. They start off dragging their kayaks across glacier crevasses which takes days and days. Then the ice smooth&rsquo;s out, the wind picks up and they kite surf along at pace, until Sarah is lifted into the air and falls hurting her back (we find out later she has broken it but didn&rsquo;t realise until back home). They press on in an all for one and one for all style, eventually getting to the lake which the river runs from and finding the river completely frozen. This is terrible news however, they find the river is melted downstream though fast and furious. The advnturers decide to do some white water kayaking down some improbably fast and narrow waterfalls. They complete the task, terrify the audience and Ben emerges from the torrent of water with only a bashed nose. Ben and Sarah hug. Erik says he wouldn&rsquo;t do it again and the audience love it. The festival takes a break for some mountain themed prizes and so the audience of budding mountaineers can stock up on necessary protein bars and hydration.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">The films resume, first for this half is &lsquo;Frozen Road&rsquo; a solo -30&deg;C bike trip filmed entirely by the cyclist Ben Page as he crosses Canada to the Arctic sea. The trip, inspired by author Jack London quotes about manliness and solitude, it almost comes across as machoistic. Ben gets very, very cold, his isolation reaches climax with his fear of being eaten by wolves. They howl while he lies in his cold dark tent. Eventually Ben is rescued by some locals in a snow storm, armed with rifles for the wolves and a body stretcher for the presumed dead Ben. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">By far the highlight of this year&rsquo;s festival was the hilarious &lsquo;Stumped&rsquo;. Maureen Beck is missing her low left arm, she starts the film telling us a list of possible incidents that could have resulted in this. Already we&rsquo;re warmed by her humour and how she obviously doesn&rsquo;t take herself too seriously. By far the best is &ldquo;don&rsquo;t wave to people when jumping from a helicopter&rdquo;. Maureen is also a pretty good rock climber who sets herself the target of climbing a grade 5.12 climb, which any climbers will know is no easy task, Maureen has over 50 attempts, the film makers engineer a surprise cameo appearance by rock god Tommy Caldwell, who with his left arm tied up attempts the climb and fails on the crux move which is blocking Maureen&rsquo;s ascent. Its back to basics time and Maureen embarks on a healthy eating and cardio exercise regimen. The film ends with Maureen finally making it but not before the film sound cut out. When she makes the climb and audience member yells &ldquo;give her a cupcake&rdquo; a reference to Maureen&rsquo;s cupcake addiction, testimony to how engaged the audience are with her character. This film is funny and beautifully shot, emphasising that paraclimbers like Maureen do not want to be told what they do is inspirational for a disabled person, they want their deserved respect as international climbing champions pushing the boundaries of what&rsquo;s conceivable.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">This year the films were extraordinary pushing both the boundaries of adventure sports, unexplored regions and tackling issues of disability, gender and ageism. The film festival managed to get a cross selection of varied pursuits each presented in different film styles. A common factor was the astonishing ability of these individuals in their chosen discipline. I look forward to next year&rsquo;s selection and encourage you to watch these films, especially &lsquo;Into Twin Galaxies&rsquo; and &lsquo;Stumped&rsquo;. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 154, 1, '2018-01-22 18:45:11', '2018-02-23 18:52:06', 'banff-film-festival-review', NULL, NULL, 0),

Lyrically, the songs are typical of romantic British folk but occasionally they break from this more traditional style (delivered with Gatrill&rsquo;s goosebump-inducing voice) to delve into layered instrumentals.The two musicians almost seem to be improvising, bouncing sounds back and forth and reacting instantly to what the other is playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The odd intermission between songs allows for jokes, and friendly chat with the audience and Emma Gatrill even hand-delivers a postcard to someone in the crowd (sent by an audience member at a previous show). Watching Gatrill and Hamblett perform is like being amongst friends -albeit incredibly talented ones- and this relaxed atmosphere continues for the rest of the evening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/79/content_hh.png\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 262px; float: left;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:12px;\">&nbsp;A blind drawing of Hamish Hawk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hamish (&ldquo;as in Hamish&rdquo;) Hawk (&ldquo;as in the bird of prey&rdquo;), the second act of the night, is best described as the kind of person that mums love. While his sweet one-man-one-guitar tunes initially come off as hokey, his charm onstage -not limited to between-song banter- becomes endearing. He shares stories about dreams in which he gets sushi with Graham Norton, and while performing he smiles and nods to audience members. He seems to have fun onstage by himself, which is in turn generously reciprocated by the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&amp;feed=%2FFresh_Air%2Finterview-with-kate-stables-this-is-the-kit%2F\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Kate Stables and company reach the stage, and immediately launch into their set with &ldquo;Two Pence Piece&rdquo;, from This is the Kit&rsquo;s latest album Moonshine Freeze. In an interview, Kate Stables has said that with this latest record, it&rsquo;s hard to know what to take the credit for, as it has been such a collaborative effort. This collaboration is evident particularly with &ldquo;Two Pence Piece&rdquo;, in the vocal harmonies provided by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qevANBIKxAo\">Rozi Plain</a>, Kate&rsquo;s friend and a successful musician in her own right, and in the percussive effects added by This is the Kit touring regulars, Neil Smith and Jamie Whitby-Coles. Emma Gatrill and Marcus Hamblett return as the horn section which adds incredible depth to the sound produced by a band of just four members. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their set varies from songs like &lsquo;Nits&rsquo;, a track from the 2015 album Bashed Out which is banjo-based, but punctuated with Sufjan Stevens-esque horns, to &lsquo;Moonshine Freeze&rsquo; the latest album&rsquo;s title track. The performance of &lsquo;Moonshine Freeze&rsquo; in particular demonstrates the benefits of the band being on a &ldquo;neverending tour&rdquo;. It is tight, well-rehearsed (not to mention performed by musicians of astounding talent) and is met with audible delight from the crowd. It is clear why Aaron Dessner and Guy Garvey are This is the Kit fans- occasionally songs are in some way reminiscent of both The National and Elbow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing is lost in the transition from record to live show. The sound of the 7-piece group is full and clear, with the bonus of being able to witness in person the fun that each member has as they interact with one another. The feeling of being amongst friends is encouraged by the fact that the musicians are indeed all friends, to which Kate remarks &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling very spoiled&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yME_52X20N8\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Towards the end of the show, all musicians but Kate take a seat on stage. They soak up the heat from the spotlights (in what is an admittedly very cold theatre- &lsquo;Cold and Got Colder&rsquo; is later dedicated to the audience) and Kate performs a cover of &ldquo;Gone Again&rdquo; by Morning Star. The lullaby-like song signals the end of the set, as when Kate finishes, the rest of the band rejoin her for the final song and well-anticipated encore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The show&rsquo;s lowkey grand finale comes in the form of the title track from Bashed Out. The National-like guitar and horn sounds combined with shimmering drums echo in the theatre and at the end, the band are visibly delighted by the energetic applause from the crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In our interview, Kate Stables said that she has been touring for over a decade. When touring is your full-time job, you tend to get quite good at it. This is the Kit are definitely good at it.</p>\r\n', 17, 1, '2018-01-25 14:06:34', '2018-01-25 14:08:45', 'this-is-the-kit-at-pleasance-theatre', 1, 89, 1),

Having just interviewed the charismatic brothers of the band, Ewan and Callum Merrett, it will be interesting to see if they can pull off the level of energy I&rsquo;ve understood they want to achieve. Both brothers have made it clear to me that they want their show to not just consist of shoegazing musicians playing their songs, but like a &ldquo;party&rdquo; where the audience goes home inspired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kcm_yJVEgdc\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the lights fade up and the audience screams, the band bounces onto stage and immediately begin playing &lsquo;Hot Head Chippenham&rsquo;, a track off their newest release,&nbsp;<i>Mixtape One &ndash; EP,&nbsp;</i>released in September. Ewan and Callum quickly establish themselves as the frontmen of the band through their enthusiastic jumping around and beckoning the crowd to sing along. Before the show, Callum told me that he was excited for the challenge of winning over an audience not necessarily there to see Bad Sounds, and now it&rsquo;s clear to see from the grinning audience and multitude of phones keen to film the set that they&rsquo;ve succeeded. It&rsquo;s hard to resist the full-sound produced by all five members of the band, highlighted by the in-sync movement of the two brothers zoning in on their akai&nbsp;beat machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the band launch into their next hit &lsquo;Zacharia&rsquo;, guitarist Charlie Pitt and bassist Sam Hunt&nbsp;begin&nbsp;to up their&nbsp;dance-factor, after Charlie announces that&nbsp;he&rsquo;s always wanted to play Barrowland. The hits keep coming with &ldquo;Are You High&rdquo; and the ever-increasing levels of enthusiasm, play-wrestling and interaction keep everyone keenly engaged. As the show goes on, tambourines are cracked out and the band members vibe with each other, undoubtedly surprised by the audience that forms a !MOSH PIT! As the crowd bobs their heads in sync to &lsquo;Avalanche&rsquo;, a song hailed as &lsquo;This Week&rsquo;s Best Album in the World&rsquo; by Radio 1&rsquo;s Annie Mac, each of the individual musical personalities begin to shine; noticeably the strong beats coming from drummer Olivia Dimery. What&rsquo;s so enjoyable about the performance is the obvious contribution from each member &ndash; the drum, bass, individual guitars and sound effects produced are all clearly distinguishable from each other yet mesh together in such a way that they produce a crisp, edgy and layered sound, helped by the great acoustics of the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4PNUoWbMPNA\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every great show must come to an end, but with Bad Sounds, the catchy guitar riffs (highlighting the band&rsquo;s love of sampling) continue, as they move into their biggest hit &lsquo;Wages&rsquo; as the finale. As the trumpets sound and the feel-good vibes radiate in the crowd, the brothers embrace on stage with huge grins on their faces. It&rsquo;s clear that everyone&rsquo;s had a great time.If a &ldquo;party&rdquo; was what the band was aiming for, it&rsquo;s clear to see that this performance lived up to expectations.

Cal moved away to London and Bristol, and got into recording bands and learning how a studio works, while I got more into hip hop and sample based stuff. We were doing separate stuff for a while, but after moving back we were both in the same house again so we thought we&rsquo;d try something out. We really liked what we did &ndash; what we were doing separately felt generic, but coming together we found a better direction.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Callum - It was exciting working that way because we were learning things off each other, whereas before we were just in the same place as guitarists.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b>You&rsquo;ve been compared to artists like Beck numerous times, along with being associated with an indie-funk style &ndash; who do you consider to be the biggest influences for your music?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>E &ndash; not indie funk, that&rsquo;s a term that destroys me! Haha no it&rsquo;s fine&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know - I feel like we&rsquo;re more into albums than artists:&nbsp; Demon Days by the Gorillaz is a massive influence on me, as well as Midnight Marauders by a Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul. I find it hard to put my finger on why I like an album &ndash; there&rsquo;s good stuff in everything.</li>\r\n	<li>C &ndash; I like Paul&rsquo;s Boutique by the Beastie Boys. That was produced by the same guys who did Odelay&nbsp;by Beck, another great album. That production duo had the biggest impact on the overall way that we think about constructing a song and our production technique. They use really cool breaks and don&rsquo;t seem to worry about chopping songs straight into each other. They make the music seem like it&rsquo;s fluid which I really like.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Why the qualm with Indie Funk?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>E - I think for me, I never considered myself into indie music. I like funk music like James Brown and Sly and the Family Stone but &lsquo;Indie Funk&rsquo; makes me think of every worst band at a festival ever. I don&rsquo;t really have any qualms with &lsquo;Indie Funk&rsquo; - I feel it comes out really bad if we&rsquo;re like DON&rsquo;T CALL US INDIE FUNK!</li>\r\n	<li>C &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s just that if someone had never heard us and then someone described us as indie funk, I don&rsquo;t really feel like that&rsquo;s the best introduction to our sound. When I think about the influences we just talked about, there&rsquo;s definitely a lot of groove based stuff and we definitely have a DIY approach to certain things which I guess the indie thing would come into, but we&rsquo;ve never really related to the indie scene. The thing is, we seem to have been taken under its wing which is a really nice compliment to be honest.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b>You&rsquo;ve said in the past that a lot of your lyrics come from conversations you&rsquo;ve had with friends. Is there a favourite memory that you associate with any of your songs?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>C &ndash; I really like the Julie story, because I don&rsquo;t really see her anymore. I used to work with her and she was just the loveliest character, so I think that every time we perform. When I get to sing that line I always think about her, and it&rsquo;s just nice for me.</li>\r\n	<li>E &ndash;I don&rsquo;t have a favourite, but the line about the dog tattoo has become more of a thing than I ever thought it was going to, especially because I&rsquo;ve never spoken to the person about it. I&rsquo;m always worried she&rsquo;s going to read it in an interview or hear somewhere that the line was about her and be like &lsquo;<i>alright, this guy&rsquo;s a bit mental!&rsquo;</i></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kcm_yJVEgdc\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>&nbsp;Talking about gigs, what&rsquo;s been the most inspirational gig you&rsquo;ve been to?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>E &ndash; I wouldn&rsquo;t say so much in terms of stage presence and stuff like that, but before we saw The Flaming Lips, I never really liked live gigs. It was the first time I&rsquo;d seen an artist put on a proper show &ndash; a gig could be fun and you&rsquo;d go home having actually enjoyed yourself and not just watched four moody people. We also saw De La Soul in Bristol, and they properly threw a party which was really cool. But yeah, I really liked the idea that it could be a fun night and not just bands playing their songs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What kind of stuff are you listening to right now?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>C &ndash; I feel like people will get the wrong idea if I say, but I listen to a lot of jazz and new jazz hip-hop hybrid stuff. There&rsquo;s a guy called Chris Dave who&rsquo;s an insane drummer.&nbsp; This guy plays live drums like J Dilla programmes them, which is really interesting. We grew up as guitarists, but as you get into sampling and hip-hop and making beats and stuff, you start paying a lot more attention to the drums.<b>&nbsp;</b></li>\r\n	<li>E &ndash; Me and Sam were just listening to some Dr. Dre&hellip;<b>&nbsp;</b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b>If you could have a dinner date with any musician, who would it be?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>C &ndash; QuestLove &ndash; he&rsquo;s my idol. I love his passion for music and his enthusiasm for learning everything about music. I want his brain.</li>\r\n	<li>E &ndash; Timbaland because it would be amazing to watch him say the most awful things over and over again.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b>To wrap up, can we expect a debut album anytime soon from you guys?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>C &ndash; I hope so!

(77, 'Sofar Sounds at the Traverse Bar Café ', 'Sofar Sounds\' Edinburgh branch hosts a secret show to connect strangers through a shared love of live music.', '<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/85/content_event-image-02-logo02.jpg\" style=\"height: 500px; width: 749px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, Rafe Offer and Rocky Start went to a music festival and were disappointed to find a lot of the audience more focused on the social scene rather than the music. This frustration inspired them to host their own gig in a friend&rsquo;s North London flat for just a handful of people. This went so well that they decided to host more. Word gradually spread about their low-key shows, and now Sofar Sounds operates in over 300 cities across the world. Little did they know that their first gathering would grow into a global movement to connect strangers through a shared love of live music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are a few things that make the Sofar Sounds gigs different from your typical concert. Firstly, you often have to apply to get a spot. Sofar Sounds expects its audience to be respectful, so no texting or talking during the performances, and, most importantly, each attendee should love music. The other distinct feature of Sofar Sounds gigs is that they label themselves as secret. While the Sofar Sounds name is anything but a secret, the locations of their events are generally released 24 hours or less before the gigs and the performers are only made known just as they are about to perform. They are also known to host both extremely and less well-known performers, so you never know what you&rsquo;re going to get. All that is certain is that the music selection will be well curated, and you&rsquo;ll have a relaxed and respectful concert atmosphere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On Thursday, January 25, I am one of the lucky ones with a spot at the Edinburgh Sofar Sounds gig. The evening before the show, I receive an email with the time and location, which this time was the Traverse Theatre. Sofar Sounds is known to host in eclectic venues, such as living rooms, churches, and shops, so I am little bummed that this show is in a more generic venue, but am nonetheless still excited for the mystery performers. I arrive and shortly after am led with the group to the Traverse Bar Caf&eacute;. As customary for Sofar Sounds shows, I plop myself on the floor towards the front of the room. I am surrounded by an audience of no one type, which I feel fits in line with the inclusive and warm image of Sofar Sounds. During the introductions, the local organisers outline the rules and ask us to hug our neighbors. Considering I am a solo attendee, I feel a bit uncomfortable about this suggestion as I observe many pairs of friends hugging each other all around me. I then look to the right and notice another female solo attendee. We look at each other for an awkward moment, shrug, and then share a nice hug. This is the kind of warm and quirky atmosphere that Sofar Sounds creates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first performers are the American duo Delightful Squalor, which consists of Lake Montgomery and Cera Impala. They announce that they only began performing together about a year ago, but you could not tell as their melodies melt together effortlessly. They take elements of blues, gospel, folk, and jazz and entrance the audience with their soothing sounds. A highlight was their song &lsquo;Molasses,&rsquo; where Delightful Squalor&rsquo;s harmonies and lyrics transport you to a balmy summer afternoon. The second act of the evening is the Edinburgh-based indie duo Milkd. While the vocals are not quite as captivating as Delightful Squalor&rsquo;s, Milkd offers charming lyrics and lulling instrumentals. Released in November, their most catchy tune &lsquo;Come Out&rsquo; brings the audience most to life with many people bopping their heads and swaying to the irresistible feel of the chorus. Next up is the Glaswegian group Static Union. Some of their music embodies a more classic alt-rock sound, while other songs, such as &lsquo;Last Resort,&rsquo; create a more nostalgic and dreamy feel with underlying synth sounds. The young Scottish four-piece group has a strong stage presence and a cool sound, and I can definitely see them making a bigger name for themselves in the near future. The last group of the night is a West Lothian-based indie rock group called The Phantoms. You can definitely feel that they are the most seasoned performers of the bunch with their confidence performing and engaging the audience, but they lack a bit of the charm I felt with the other more recently established groups. Overall, Sofar Sounds does what it is known to do by delivering a wonderful selection of live performers in a truly warm, respectful, and intimate space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 23, 1, '2018-02-05 16:48:23', '2018-02-05 17:01:44', 'sofar-sounds-at-the-traverse-bar-cafe', 1, NULL, 1),

It was a shame that the weaknesses that would mar this otherwise outstanding production reared their heads so early on. Nonetheless it would be mistake not to try and catch the final performance of this production, directed by Joe Christie, at Bedlam Theatre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The set, designed by Iona Tangri, was the standout feature of the production. It made use of every inch of the Bedlam Theatre stage, making it appear much larger than it really is. The attention to detail was unrivalled, from the wallpaper and mounted wall lights to the wear in the chicken wire, piles of dirt on the stage and the clutter on the work surface, lending the production a much more professional appearance than most student theatre can expect attain. The costume was also totally coherent and true to the setting, thanks to the efforts of designer Laura Hounsell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was complimented by some fantastic tech, comprising of sound design by Huw Jones and lighting by Elissa Webb. It was a rare instance of sound being employed effectively in theatre to create atmosphere under the dialogue, although on more than one instance the dialogue was drowned out, although this was likely only a first night slip-up just like the occasional overly abrupt cuts like the one at the beginning of the play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The script, translated from Bouchard&rsquo;s original Quebec French, is beautifully balanced between moments of intense emotion and bittersweet humour which was largely carried by Davies in the role of Tom, the ad executive from the Big City. Despite his initial hesitancy, he warmed into the role throughout the play, switching nicely from Tom&rsquo;s childlike internal dialogue to his loaded exchanges with the other characters. More, perhaps, could have been made of this element of the script, occasionally Davies&rsquo; pace meant that the change of mood was lost. The development of his relationship with Agatha, the bereaved mother of his lover, was particularly moving. Tilly Botsford, playing Agatha, was deeply empathetic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a certain separation between the character of Francis as implied by script and the performance given by Peter Morrison; Bouchard&rsquo;s writing evoked an ignorantly bitter young man, left behind in the fringes of society, not only by his own brother but by the fast- advancing world as well. Morrison, although an energetic and committed actor, never quite manages to convincingly convey the monstrous anger living inside Francis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christie should be proud of this feat of a production that would undoubtedly have merited five stars if it had been afforded a little extra time to mature and sharpen up.</p>\r\n', 180, 1, '2018-02-10 11:57:09', '2018-02-10 12:06:28', 'tom-at-the-farm-at-bedlam-theatre', 3, NULL, 0),

It is an ambitious 16-track song cycle that is heavily inspired by folk stalwarts like Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and Leonard Cohen.

It&rsquo;s not something we&rsquo;ve always wanted to do, it just happened. Brandon and I are brothers, and when the other two brothers Josh and Andy moved into the same area, it was just a progression after that.

The last few songs I&rsquo;ve been writing which will obviously be going to a second album are probably less personal. The first album is probably a bit more personal; not like my top-secret stuff, but the second album is trying less hard on lyrics. I don&rsquo;t think anyone really cares that much about lyrics, and I spend ages thrashing my head over some lyrics -&nbsp; there&rsquo;s plenty of songs where so long as it&rsquo;s a good tune, I don&rsquo;t think people worry about lyrics too much.

It&rsquo;s nice to do some stuff we&rsquo;ve already done just because we like doing it but then it&rsquo;s good to try new things as well. I think there&rsquo;s a lot of different stuff in the first album. I think that interests us a lot more than just writing the same song 12 times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>After performing live, how do you feel if a show has gone well?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Josh: I think when you know that everyone who came had a good time.

When the lights dim and the four bounce on stage, beginning their set with &lsquo;Last Night&rsquo;, I see this in action with hands beginning to frantically wave, screaming girls and much to my surprise a (rowdy!)&nbsp;mosh&nbsp;pit forming. When I interviewed the band backstage, they were very laid back, so it&rsquo; surprising when the music begins and the band-members all explode with enthusiasm at the crowd&rsquo;s response.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the set continues, the feel-good, fast-paced music continues, with strong rhythms from bassist Andy Davidson (along with sips of his corona), and the synched rock-star jumps that him and his brother Josh, the guitarist, execute to theirs (and the crowd&rsquo;s) amusement. Mid-way through the set, the music briefly settles down as the band transition into their acoustic set, full of great minor progressions, with hits &lsquo;Will You Be There&rsquo; and &lsquo;Candlelight&rsquo;; a crowd&nbsp;favourite, especially when lead singer&nbsp;Kiaran&nbsp;Crook asks everyone to take out their phone flashlights. Although a bit of an Ed&nbsp;Sheeran&nbsp;move, the lights actually work in the small venue, and it&rsquo;s clear that the crowd is loving it. The band reach their romantic &lsquo;Heart of Gold&rsquo; which starts off slow but accelerates into a loud football chant led by the band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHjujoZ1bF4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHjujoZ1bF4</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This exciting beat sets the tone for a great finish to the set, as the crowd is&nbsp;re-energised&nbsp;(not that their energy has lulled at all). Through the song &lsquo;Nobody Knows&rsquo; the intricacy of Brandon Crook&rsquo;s drumming hits a high point with his impressive hard-hitting, groovy rhythms, highlighted by his much-deserved solos. As the song goes on, it is clear to see some of the band&rsquo;s influences with Oasis-like riffs in the bridges (the band are going on tour with Liam Gallagher this month), which though similar to other&nbsp;indie-rock&nbsp;riffs, take a clear direction of their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gun47t0hFIY\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gun47t0hFIY</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final two songs, &lsquo;Live for the Moment&rsquo; and &lsquo;Chasing Shadows&rsquo;, the band&rsquo;s biggest hits, round up the gig, with the audience erupting in chants. It&rsquo;s great to see the band&nbsp;vibing&nbsp;off the audience, as the interaction between them becomes noticeably more playful. This night has showed off the Sherlocks&rsquo; music: an array of upbeat songs made up of&nbsp;indie-rock&nbsp;guitar chords and romantic lyrics, with a rough edge. As the set comes to an end, both the band and the crowd are sweaty and panting; signs of a good night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/93/content_28167771_2035876760027714_374694567091736101_n.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 533px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Catch the&nbsp;Sherlocks&nbsp;on Liam Gallagher&rsquo;s European tour (<a href=\"http://liamgallagher.com/tour\">http://liamgallagher.com/tour</a>&nbsp;) or at various festivals over the summer (<a href=\"http://www.thesherlocksmusic.co.uk/#tour\">http://www.thesherlocksmusic.co.uk/#tour</a>&nbsp;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;You can listen to their debut album&nbsp;<i>Live For The Moment&nbsp;</i>on&nbsp;Spotify: (<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/4SrofCfzlhtiKRAsMfBxV4\">https://open.spotify.com/artist/4SrofCfzlhtiKRAsMfBxV4</a>&nbsp;) and iTunes (<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-sherlocks/531251807\">https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-sherlocks/531251807</a>&nbsp;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to know more, head to their website for all social&nbsp;medias,&nbsp;merch&nbsp;and tour info!&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thesherlocksmusic.co.uk/#tour\">http://www.thesherlocksmusic.co.uk/#tour</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All photo credits go to Findlay Macdonald (<a href=\"http://thewideo.com/\">http://thewideo.com/</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To hear more about The Sherlocks, click here for an interview with them before the show:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://freshair.org.uk/posts/a-sit-down-with-the-sherlocks\">https://freshair.org.uk/posts/a-sit-down-with-the-sherlocks</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/90/content_The%2BSherlocks-3.jpg\" /></p>\r\n', 172, 1, '2018-02-20 12:28:23', '2018-02-22 15:32:52', 'the-sherlocks-at-the-liquid-rooms-edinburgh', 1, NULL, 1),

Their second studio album <i>Sauna</i> is an eclectic mix of groovy and vibrant beats, which demonstrates a more light-hearted and funky vibe than its predecessor, <i>Spanish Disco</i>. Leyya&nbsp;really know how to mix it up, alternating between soft haunting vocals, catchy hooks and intriguing drum solos. The smooth and dreamy ambience of <i>Sauna</i> takes you on a journey as the album explores an array of unique sounds and textures in a world where <i>&quot;everything is the same&quot;</i>. Despite their hectic schedule, I managed to chat to Leyya&nbsp;before their gig in the Waiting Room in London last week.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><b>So you&#39;re playing tonight at the Waiting Room in London.

The thing is, normally we don&#39;t really have time to actually visit the city, so it depends on how much time we have. But we are going to play in Mexico and Austin in March, and we do have time to see a few places there.

Normally we just have a few pieces of clothes with us, because we don&#39;t have the room to bring a lot of clothes, so there are not that many options. We have like 4 or 5 outfits that we always use and then we just decide which one to use on that night. The most important thing is that we wear colours, and not just black and white clothes.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><b>Right now you are on tour promoting your new album <i>Sauna</i>.

With the second album, people actually want to hear your new music, so there is a little bit of pressure and you work differently. But we tried not to think about the pressure and we wanted to take our time. We actually postponed the release of our album three times or so, because we were not really happy with everything, and we wanted to make an album that were 100% happy with, which was a little bit harder than we thought. With the album, we tried to combine new ideas and create new ways of writing. We took ideas from everywhere; from different cultures, from different stories, and from different perspectives. &nbsp;We tried not to limit ourselves with sound. At first, we thought that we had to create the same sound that we created in the first album. But then at one point we decided not to do that, so we got creative and just did whatever came to our minds. I guess, that was a little bit different than what we did with the first one, because with the first one we had one sound in mind and we wanted to do exactly that, but with the second one we&nbsp; just tried and tried and whatever we liked, we kept. So we just played around and made stupid ideas with the songs.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"tab-stops:246.75pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><b>What is the meaning behind the name <i>Sauna</i>, and why did you choose that as the album title?</b></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">We chose that name for a few different reasons. The first time we thought about the title <i>Sauna</i>, was when we were doing a recording a few years ago. We recorded a few instruments in a wooden cabin - like a small wooden house on a landside - and there were no windows and it was pretty hot; it was in summer. We posted a picture on social media and someone commented like, <i>&quot;haha the new album title is going to be Sauna&quot;</i>. And I think that was the very first time that we heard that, and we thought, that&#39;s pretty cool actually. We didn&#39;t really think about it when we wrote the songs but when we were close to finishing the songs, we remembered that comment and we thought that <i>Sauna</i> is actually pretty cool, because the word looks quite round and it&#39;s a really nice word to say, and that&#39;s the idea that we want to create with the music as well; a nice, round, floating theme. And we liked the idea behind it; that people are in a sauna with no clothes, and they don&#39;t have material things to show. In that room, they are all naked; everyone is just the same. It&#39;s a pretty nice idea, and that&#39;s what we wanted to do with the music as well. We wanted to combine every sound, so we&#39;d have a sound from one country and then another sound from one genre; and it would be like everything is the same.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/95/content_3614978597898_600.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; float: left; height: 300px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><b>The album artwork is gorgeous, who created it?</b></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Thank you! I painted the woman on the cover and Marco did the collage of the rainbow and the blue background. We want to always create everything that stands for us, we want to make it ourselves as it represents us and we don&#39;t want someone else to do that because they mostly don&#39;t know what we want. So we just make it ourselves.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><b>Which song from the album means the most to you?</b></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Well, that&#39;s a hard question because we worked on every track for a long time and we did a lot for every song because we wanted to make it 100% perfect for us, and it&#39;s hard to say which one is the favourite out of that as each one is somehow special in our eyes. So I can&#39;t really decide but maybe I would say &#39;In Your Head&#39;, because I really like that its very smooth and soft in the beginning and in the end its very hard, loud and heavy. That&#39;s what I like; the combination of these two things.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><b>Do you guys have a say in the production of the music videos? </b></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">We are involved in that, because again, it is something that represents us. We want to tell our story with everything that we do, so we try to involve ourselves in everything. If you work with someone making these videos, you always have to collaborate and work together. They have an idea and we have an idea, and then we combine these ideas into one video. So we are involved, and we don&#39;t want to publish something that someone else did for us.

I mean, that&#39;s what we did a few years ago, and this is what we do now. You change as a person all the time and that&#39;s what you do when you make&nbsp; music; your music changes as well. I wouldn&#39;t say that I would do something differently with the songs. The song is how it is, that&#39;s how we wrote it back then, and we liked it back then, so it&#39;s okay!</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><b>Do you have plans to start writing a third album or will you both take a break after your tour?</b></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">We always make music and when we finished the album, we started making music again.

The room was already busy for the support from Glaswegian quintet Spinning Coins, although they do little to get the crowd going. It seems the early birds were more focussed on getting a good spot for the main attraction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Alvvays do appear, it isn&rsquo;t long before the atmosphere lifts and everyone is gently shuffling along, with a group of enthusiastic boppers down the front. The crowd feels familiar to me. These are the people who were going wild at the Two Door Cinema Club headlined NME tour back in the day, but now we&rsquo;re all a little older and wiser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The simple visuals projected behind the band in bold primary colours are squishy and primal; I&rsquo;m reminded of the evolution of cells under a microscope. The abstract, dreamlike quality perfectly matches the soft, spacey vocals and they&rsquo;re interesting enough to draw my eye without pulling focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole performance is stripped back, with little conversation between songs aside from&nbsp;Rankin&nbsp;remarking on the difficulty of pronouncing &lsquo;Sauchiehall Street&rsquo;, something any non-Scot will be able to relate to. Although she isn&rsquo;t chatty,&nbsp;Rankin&nbsp;is an engaging&nbsp;frontperson&nbsp;and her crystal clear vocals cut through the music beautifully.&nbsp;Alvvays&nbsp;are not a band about big personalities, and I really appreciate her understated presence as the driving force of the performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXu6q-6JKjA\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The set is a mix of tracks from&nbsp;Alvvays&rsquo;s&nbsp;first self-titled album and their 2017 offering&nbsp;<em>Antisocialites,&nbsp;</em>but with only one track from&nbsp;<em>Antisocialites</em>&nbsp;unplayed it&rsquo;s evident that this tour is the showcase for their new material<em>.</em>&nbsp;The newer tracks fit in seamlessly with the older ones.

This is the magical moment I choose to put on my&nbsp;Snapchat&nbsp;story, and the positive response I got confirms it was the highlight of the gig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The no-fuss encore consists of an&nbsp;Elastica&nbsp;cover and &lsquo;Next of Kin&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s the perfect goodbye, leaving us all wanting a little more and in doing so ensuring that they&rsquo;ll be back gracing another Glasgow venue soon. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a&nbsp;pacey, no-frills set which demonstrates&nbsp;Alvvays&rsquo;s&nbsp;wide appeal.

Out of habit, I arrived a bit late, but I truly wish I hadn&rsquo;t. Arriving on time would have allowed me more time to watch and listen to Jo Quail, a London-based experimental electric cellist. Opening for two of the heaviest music acts in history as a solo string instrumentalist must be nerve-wracking, but Quail&rsquo;s set was brilliant and deeply moving. Using only a loop pedal, Quail manages to summon sounds out of her cello that seem impossible. Each song is expansive and and includes dissonant wails and sounds that could have been mistaken for a kick drum had she not generated the sound with a bow and some strings right in front of the audience. Just a couple minutes into her set, it becomes clear why Boris invited her to join them &ndash; in her music was some similarity to the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4vRrGCVlMHk?t=1m50s\">early soundscapes</a> of post-rock groups like Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and Boris&rsquo;s reverence for that sound runs deep.

Boris is a legendary boundary-pushing metal band from Japan that has been fundamentally changing the field of heavy music for over 20 years. Among the objects on the stage are a gong, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akuma_no_Uta#Cover_art\">double-necked guitar</a>, and more amplifiers than one band should ever need. Boris walks on stage, and the crowd goes wild. And then the music actually starts. I&rsquo;ll preface this section by saying that, in my opinion, Boris&rsquo;s latest album was just good &ndash; a great exhibition of their sound, but nothing groundbreaking. None of that mattered when they began to play. The pure weight of Boris&rsquo;s live performances is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/12/arts/music/12boris.html\">well known</a>, but nothing prepared me for the solid wall that hit me.

The&nbsp;company of&nbsp;Our Country&rsquo;s Good has&nbsp;transformed the stage, extending it into the audience, replacing the space lost to this extension with seating around the edges of the stage.&nbsp;Taking advantage of this,&nbsp;I sat myself in one of the on-stage seats. It was before I could get over my slight discomfort of not being another face in a crowd, that the play began. The lights dropped and suddenly there were bone chilling screams. This first scene depicted the travel of the convict ships to Australia in a vividly raw way. The screams rose from a character that was being brutally whipped. Immediately and without warning the play had started, the tone was set and the audience was engrossed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This production of Our Country&rsquo;s Good was impressive, and my biggest issues were with the script itself. I occasionally found myself lost in the dialogue as the scene-setting speech was hidden within the guise of other conversations. Even then, I quickly forgot about this confusion as the play continued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The acting was incredible. Most actors took on two roles, one of a convict and one of an officer. Flipping between the abuser and the abused required talent: an ability to shift your tone, attitude and intention. It also highlighted the fact that all the characters are people, no matter their traits. That being said, the stand out performances were found within the convict characters. The humanity, pain, emotion, love, loss, struggle, joy, humor, and redemption captured by the convict characters played on the hearts of the audience, keeping us engrossed in their stories, as well as the wider play. Liz, played by Tiffany Garnham, is a brilliant character brilliantly portrayed. The idea of redemption flowed from her story line, along with a pain and sympathy that is undeniable. Duckling and Wisehammer, played by&nbsp;Anna Swinton and&nbsp;Matthew Sedman respectively, offered the audience emotional performances. The character of Duckling gave a raw and often discomforting tale of brutal love, while Wisehammer was powerfully endearing.&nbsp;The officers were essential to the story and well portrayed, but, as I believe is the purpose of the play, it was the convicts that sold the show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to note the goal of this play. Our Country&rsquo;s Good tells the tale of redemption in order to show the humanity of prisoners and raise questions in the audience about the current treatment of people in the prison system. This production was immaculately done. I give credit to the directors, Luke Morley and Jane Prinsley, as they captured this theme and conveyed it to the audience. I believe there was not a single audience member that did not walk away with, at least, sympathy for the convicts if not a deep heart break at the conditions displayed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This production of Our Country&rsquo;s Good, showing at Bedlam Theatre&nbsp;from the 26th of February to the 3rd of March, was a striking production that I am glad I did not miss.</p>\r\n', 143, 1, '2018-03-02 13:47:43', '2018-03-02 13:47:43', 'our-country-s-good-review', 3, NULL, 0),

Hip-hop is still recovering from the from the deaths of Biggie Smalls and 2pac. For many, the murders of these larger than life figures signals the end of rap&rsquo;s golden era. Out of the dying embers of that era, Mos Def and Talib Kweli, as Black Star emerged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both emcees were already known in the boroughs of New York as prodigious lyricists.&nbsp;Black Star was an amalgamation of all of hip-hop&rsquo;s best aspects. They didn&#39;t just impact the listener sonically, they used the canvas of the mind. You&rsquo;re taken to the streets of Harlem, you&rsquo;re put into the shoes of a young African-American. Black Star is a story, it&rsquo;s a history lesson about struggle and triumph.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historically Black Star was the name of a ship, bought by Marcus Garvey to bolster the African global economy. Marcus Garvey was a hero in the community, serving as&nbsp;the leader of the Universal Negro Improvement Association.&nbsp;The Black Star Line derived its name from the White Star Line, a prominent shipping corporation owned by the British. Garvey didn&rsquo;t just think he could match the success of the White Star Line, but outdo them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Black Star indulges the listener with a detailed account of what its like to be a young African American growing up in Harlem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes focusing too much on the bigger picture dilutes the message. Black Star was able to tread this line masterfully. They touched on themes such as African-American esteem, culture, love and pride. Everything is told through a personal story, through the experiences of the black youth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Definition&rdquo; is inspired by the Boogie Down Productions song &ldquo;Stop the Violence&rdquo;.&nbsp;Kweli&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mos&nbsp;Def&nbsp;philosophize the concept of death in the black community, pointing to all the martyrs who have struggled for black independence. They interpolate &ldquo;Children&rsquo;s Story&rdquo; by Slick Rick, turning it into a tale of how a frustrated black child resorts to crime when society has failed to give him the opportunity to succeed. In the story, the boy resorts to alcoholism and drugs to numb the pain and dull his conscience. Ultimately, he is cornered by society&rsquo;s &ldquo;enforcers&rdquo;, the police who take his life. &ldquo;B Boys Will B Boys&rdquo;, is a throwback to&nbsp;breakdance&nbsp;scene, which hip hop was born out of in the late 1970s. &ldquo;Respiration&rdquo; is one of the most stirring tracks on the album. It&rsquo;s a poetic juxtaposition of despair and hope. It parodies the idea of New York being the city that never sleeps. While the saying often has a positive connotation, here it means insomnia. Gun violence till the crack of dawn.&nbsp;Mos&nbsp;Def&nbsp;and&nbsp;Talib&nbsp;Kweli, find their source of inspiration in the beauty of the moon hanging over the New York skyline like a crown. The brisk night air is intoxicating, a breath of new life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The entire album is produced by&nbsp;Hi-Tek, who had worked extensively as&nbsp;Kweli&rsquo;s&nbsp;counterpart in Reflection Eternal.&nbsp;Hi-Tek&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t experiment into any new territory in his tracks, but that&rsquo;s not where the beauty of his production lies. It&rsquo;s the selection of samples, which capture the spirit of the album. The sampling of artists such as&nbsp;Gil&nbsp;Scott-Heron, Minnie&nbsp;Ripperton, Boogie Down Productions, even the documentary Style Wars, sent out a strong artistic message. Each sample brought a taste of flair and authenticity that embellished the Black Star ethos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twenty years on, this album lives as a fable. It&rsquo;s a pillar of strength for the African-American community. To this day, it&rsquo;s the only release under Black Star.&nbsp;Mos&nbsp;Def&nbsp;and&nbsp;Talib&nbsp;Kweli&nbsp;went on to have successful individual careers, but fans have always craved a sequel. Given the current climate of race relations in the United States, this is a likely prospect. Black Star couldn&rsquo;t be more relevant. Fortunately, it looks like a reunion could be in the mix, with&nbsp;Madlib&nbsp;rumored to be supplying Black Star with production.

Some of Edinburgh&rsquo;s most creative and bravest minds are coming together to put an end to the malaise. The Hidden Door festival is a brilliant concept. In 2017, they took the abandoned Old Leith Theatre and turned it into the main festival venue. This year, right across, they discovered the abandoned Former State Cinema. The festival aims to provide a mainstream platform to audiences who are looking to establish themselves in the music industry. Local artists from Edinburgh are obviously favoured. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">The Launch Party, which was hosted at the Liquid Rooms, featured three acts. Four acts were initially intended, but due to the weather conditions, Pronto Mama, weren&rsquo;t able to come and perform. The show carried on with the other three scheduled performers, Midi Paul, Reverse Engineer and Ela Orleans. Midi Paul was the opener, walking onto the stage with his bass guitar, hooked up to the various gadgets on the DJ table. He started off with a synthy post-disco groove. He simultaneously played the bass, while adding instrumental layers with midi launch pad in front of him. Midi Paul&rsquo;s artistic diversity was really on display, blending elements of electronic, progressive rock and dub into his set. While the music was mixed well and Paul is obviously talented, the set up limited the experience of the performance a bit. The long table that stretched from one end of the stage to the other felt like a barrier that led to somewhat of a restrained performance. At times, it felt like the audience checked out of the music, focusing more on their conversations than the music. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">Reverse engineering was up next, offering a mix of proto-jungle, proto-techno and house. His music emits the nostalgia of a music scene from the 70s or the 80s. The energy slow seeps into the crowd, as people begin to dance. The Reverse Engineer has a very meticulous approach to his sets, incrementally adding a new sound into the fold as the mix goes on. It&rsquo;s easy to tell that The Reverse Engineer is excited to be here, getting jiggy to his music, behind the table. Again the table, really feels like a barrier to enjoying this launch party more. Scenes for genres such as house and electric usually have a very intimate setting, at the end of the day DJ&rsquo;s are really just normal people like us. Considering that this is not a big arena, the confrontational nature of the setting is a bit of limitation when it comes to enjoying the concert more. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">Ela Orleans is the closer. To see the talented Polish artist, based in Glasgow is an exciting prospect. Orleans joins the stage and begins to set up, asking the audience to quiet down. They oblige. The barrier-like set up of the tables suits her personality best, as you get the sense that she is more of an introverted type who conveys the intimacy of her music through the sounds she uses. Ela Orleans is like a more refined blend of the first two performances at the launch. She provides some very swingy beats, which slowly transform into beautifully harmonized tunes. A lot of personality is felt with the quirky sounds that she adds into each song. Orleans&rsquo; vocals give off an eerie-sort of vibe, they seem to have an important role in the overall experience of her music. At times the music can get irritating as it&rsquo;s impossible to really hear Orleans&rsquo; vocals properly. While you get a basic sense of the pitch and the tone, it feels like you&rsquo;re not truly experiencing true extent of Orleans&rsquo; talent. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">The Hidden Door Festival is obviously a huge deal. It should be a mandatory event for every resident in Edinburgh, if such a law existed. While you get a bit of a taste of what to expect through the visuals and the musical performances, the launch wasn&rsquo;t without its dull moments. It&rsquo;s perfectly fine for music to be a conversational lubricant, but at times it felt like people were more interested in their conversations than the music. That might speak to the people in attendance or the fact that there weren&rsquo;t any performers who could really get the crowd up and dancing. After all, the launch is for a festival, the performers are obviously talented, but it was hard to truly get a festive sense from the event.</span></span></span></p>\r\n', 142, 1, '2018-03-05 12:58:18', '2018-03-05 12:58:46', 'hidden-door-launch-party-review', 1, NULL, 0),
(91, 'Romeo and Juliet at Pleasance Theatre', 'A stellar cast carry this unfinished production', '<p><span style=\"font-size:12px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/101/content_whereartthoudressrunpics-272_preview.jpeg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 533px;\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px;\">Romeo and Juliet-&nbsp;Edinbrugh University Shakespeare Company&nbsp;at Pleasance Theatre: Tuesday 6th - Saturday 10th March, 1930.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12px;\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">The stage of the Pleasance Theatre is expansive, especially with the addition of a thrust and I felt that the set did not make full use of the opportunities afforded it. The architecturally sloped flats were a drab navy blue, which detracted from their interesting shape. Juliet&rsquo;s window, wheeled around by two faithful chorus members, was underwhelming and often distracting when it got stuck in the wings. The only real points of interest were a scrappy light sculpture, disproportionately small, and a device using material stretched over the flats and back lighting to create a temporary window. The latter was effective when used, however it possible could have been used more. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12px;\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">During the audience-in the cast were arranged on the stage in a funereal tableau which nicely set the tone and without which the stage would have looked very bare, however as the production began they exited unceremoniously, rather detracting from the impact it had had. It was a nicely symbolic touch to have the Principal of Shakespeare Company Grace Dickson speak the prologue and onwards from this point the high standard of the acting meant that even with the small snags and weaknesses, this was a brilliant show. &nbsp;Will Peppercorn in the role of Mercutio was wonderful; his Queen Mab speech was one of the highlights of the evening, and he, along with Michael Black as Benvolio and Kirsten Millar as the Nurse particularly possessed that rare gift with young actors of Shakespeare of being to convey the Baird&rsquo;s words with absolute clarity, speaking them as naturally and spontaneously as if they were their own. This was largely true of the entire cast; even smaller roles were clearly in command of the language and performed with total conviction. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12px;\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">Millar deserves mention also for her comedy and energy. Alongside her, Joe Christie as Peter, also bought warm and charming comedy, and the pairing added variation to the tone of the production. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12px;\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">Eliza Lawrence made an endearing Juliet- it is easy to forget how two dimensional the role is,&nbsp;though she relied heavily on fidgety movements to create naturalism, which sometimes became distracting. I also felt that an opportunity was lost here with her costume. Lawrence is captivating but she seemed to be dressed as herself rather than the young, wealthy, beautiful Juliet. Her ball dress was an unusual dull green two piece that carried no impact on stage, especially alongside the jewel tone dresses worn by Lady Capulet and other chorus members. There were some outstanding costumes, such as those of Lady Capulet and Escalus but overall, inconsistency gave the production the appearance of a rehearsal. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12px;\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">Maddy Willing&rsquo;s composition supported the production beautifully. It was particularly effective during some of Romeo&rsquo;s early speeches, when Finlay McAfee&rsquo;s directorial skill first showed its hand. The cast were frozen in intricately constructed tableaux, allowing Romeo to move between them towards Juliet, captivated by her beauty. Douglas Clark is a very fiery Romeo and gives the role more graity than it sometimes has, for which he must be commended.&nbsp;Fight scenes were also slick, exciting, and full of energy, especially between Tybalt and Romeo. Blood and retractable blades, so often at risk of being gimmicky, were well deployed. The only minor weakness was that the choreography had omitted to consider the audience members like ourselves who were seated on either side of the thrust, so that certain illusions, though surely impactful from further back in the auditorium were lost for us. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12px;\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">This was a thoroughly enjoyable evening of theatre and a fine example of the acting talent in Edinburgh. It would be an ideal &ldquo;first Shakespeare play&rdquo; to see, and one might reasonably expect this to be the case for some audience members. It was perhaps not the show stopping 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary production that Shakespeare Society had promised us but a production to be proud of nonetheless and I am sure that many of the glitches will be ironed out by Saturday evening. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 180, 1, '2018-03-07 12:29:29', '2018-03-07 18:41:48', 'romeo-and-juliet-at-pleasance-theatre', 3, NULL, 0),

Put it this way: it&rsquo;s hard not to begrudge Tom Misch his success when we were both born in 1995 but only one of us is beginning a two-month European and North American tour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I take solace only in the fact that Tom Misch&rsquo;s success is well-earned. His popularity is undoubtedly deserved. His show in The Venue at Glasgow&rsquo;s Oran Mor is testament to this popularity, particularly among young people who comprise most of the crowd. Their singing and enthusiasm for his brand of relaxed J Dilla-esque jazz is indication that they don&rsquo;t feel bitter about his age. Any of the bitterness I once held towards the very successful 22-year-old dissipates as Tom Misch begins his 90 minute set with &lsquo;The Journey&rsquo;, the lo-fi violin-looping opener to Beat Tape 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The set continues with &lsquo;Colours of Freedom&rsquo;, a guitar frilled dance track and &lsquo;I Wish&rsquo; a slower blend of lounge-style jazz and hip-hop beats punctuated by a funky walking bassline. &lsquo;It Runs Through Me&rsquo;, Misch&rsquo;s newest bossa-inspired single from the upcoming debut album (Geography, to be released April 2018) is one of Misch&rsquo;s many crowd-pleasers throughout the show. Others include the instrumental cover of Stevie Wonder&rsquo;s &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t She Lovely&rsquo; (the crowd provides the vocals) and later he brings his sister, actor Polly Misch, to the stage for &lsquo;Movie&rsquo;, where she recreates the dialogue from the start of the song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DUzEYcR2VtM\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The mellow, grooving twist which he applies to various genres- funk, soul, hip-hop and smooth jazz to name a few- is perhaps derived from 15 year old Misch&rsquo;s love of producer J Dilla. Jaydee&rsquo;s chill, head-bobbing brand of hiphop, for example, is echoed in the lowkey beats which underscore all of Tom Misch&rsquo;s music. Misch has, naturally, also accrued other musical influences since 15. An example is &lsquo;Tick-Tock&rsquo;, a new song from Geography, in which the influence of Massive Attack&rsquo;s &lsquo;Teardrop&rsquo; is audible. The song wells up in a crescendo of violin and the ticking of a clock, building up to fill the room before finally breaking into an upbeat dance track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tom Misch&rsquo;s eclectic inspirations are perhaps both a boon and a hindrance. On the one hand, it allows him to explore and experiment with a wide range of musical sources. On the other hand, it means that his music occasionally veers toward being poor imitations of other artists&rsquo; sounds. Tom Misch is a young artist, yet to define a sound that is truly his. The music that he makes is agreeable if not second-hand, but he has a passion for beat-making and a knack for crowd-pleasing which will no doubt improve with age. This I cannot begrudge him</p>\r\n', 17, 1, '2018-03-09 21:34:24', '2018-03-09 21:34:24', 'tom-misch-at-glasgow-s-oran-mor', 1, 89, 1),
(93, 'Wiley at The Liquid Room', 'The Godfather of Grime brings the heat to Edinburgh.', '<p><em>Writers: Rebecca Somer &amp; Mariam Sadoun&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/104/content_IMG_0396.JPG\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 525px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While promoting his upcoming album <em>Godfather II</em>, Wiley makes a stop in Edinburgh at the unlikely grime venue, The Liquid Room. While grime has taken Britain and more recently the world by storm, it does not have a heavy presence in Edinburgh. Edinburgh&rsquo;s lackluster feeling towards grime is reflected in the numbers. The gig is far from packed, and even at times feels somewhat empty with a large amount of free space even close to the stage. This could be because it was rescheduled due to the prior week&rsquo;s Beast of the East snowstorm, but you would still expect a stronger turn out for the Godfather of Grime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the numbers, Wiley brings the heat and fittingly opens with &lsquo;Been a While&rsquo;, a single released less than a month ago from his highly anticipated <em>Godfather II</em> studio album. This solid, icy performance is inline with all that his trademark &lsquo;eskibeat&rsquo; flow stands for. It emits the classic pulsating grime sound that Wiley originated. Another strong moment is his sharp execution of another recent tune, &lsquo;I Call the Shots&rsquo;, which was the first single released from the upcoming album. As the night progresses, Wiley shifts from new to old music, demonstrating his ability to create hits that withstand the test of time. He performs classic throwbacks like &lsquo;Heatwave&rsquo;, &lsquo;Too Many Man&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Wearing My Rolex&rsquo; that definitely invigorate the crowd and his avid fans. Wiley is also sharp and focused during the delivery of his verse on the Roll Deep collab track &lsquo;I Will Not Lose&rsquo;. Given Wiley only has a few verses on this shared five minute original track, the DJ takes it from there and mixes it up by dropping some cool samples against the electric skittering bassline. Overall, his older tracks seem to liven and resonate with the audience most, and this is something Wiley is aware of. He has told numerous sources that <em>Godfather II</em> will be his last ever album due to his age and waning support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the fact that Wiley&rsquo;s time in the limelight may be up, he still brings his a-game and leaves a memorable mark on the audience. Whilst Wiley joined the music scene likely before much of the audience was born, the generational gap is barely noticeable. The crowd absorbs Wiley&rsquo;s energy and moshes the night away to his fast-beat, polyrhythmic sounds. This highlights how the relevance of Wiley&rsquo;s music transcends generations of youth. From his early days creating garage music with college friends to starting grime with his crew Roll Deep up until today where he continues making grime-electro fusion bangers that appeal to the masses, Wiley is clearly a multi-talented, versatile artist, and it is sad to see his career approach its end. No matter what, Wiley has cemented his legendary status in the U.K. music scene, so he can now kick back and watch budding talent continue to take the British sound into unexplored territories just like he did nearly two decades ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wiley is known to be a great supporter of many up-and-coming grime artists. With this inclusive spirit, he brings out two unknown guest artists towards the end of his set. Although the crowd does not receive them with too much enthusiasm, kudos to Wiley for supporting local talent and extending his platform. It is a shame though that the second group he brings out end up closing the show. Though this guest group attempts to sustain the prior energy generated, it does not live up and results in an anticlimactic ending to the show. We would have much preferred one final farewell from the Godfather himself.</p>\r\n', 23, 1, '2018-03-12 19:12:06', '2018-03-12 19:32:42', 'wiley-at-the-liquid-room', 1, NULL, 1),

Nevertheless, Morris manages to cram the room full of her rapidly growing&nbsp;fan base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding the incredible capabilities of her own voice and instrumental talent to captivate an audience, Morris only requires three other instrumentalists on stage to create her unique sound. She begins with, &lsquo;Push Me to My Limit&rsquo;, a track which doesn&rsquo;t really seem to go anywhere but instead just hangs in the air with ambient beauty, a real opening statement of, &ldquo;Yeah, I can sing really well&rdquo;. This is cleverly mixed into one of the more upbeat electronic songs of the album, &lsquo;Reborn&rsquo;, which was released as a single back in 2015. &nbsp;This is also where we get our first glimpse of Morris&rsquo; interesting style of onstage freestyle dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The set continues with tracks such as &lsquo;Wait for the Rain&rsquo;, a powerful&nbsp;synth&nbsp;ridden dance track and &lsquo;Rose Garden&rsquo;, a more intense song ending with an almost rave breakdown, a strange yet exciting juxtaposition from the relatively calm nature of the rest of Morris&rsquo; performance. &lsquo;Do It&rsquo;, one of the big pop songs from the album, receives a huge reaction from the crowd as well as &lsquo;Love Again&rsquo;, one of the largest hits from her previous album. Morris performs another previous album hit, &lsquo;Cold&rsquo;, which had originally featured her recording partner,&nbsp;Fryars. In his absence, Morris brings forward her drummer, who performs an emotional rendition of one of Rae&rsquo;s biggest love songs. Unfortunately, the impact of this track and various others are rather let down by the lack of intricacy in the lighting display, which somewhat resembles being at a school disco and fails to&nbsp;emphasise&nbsp;the light and shade of the dynamic music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before beginning &lsquo;Dancing with Character&rsquo;, Morris explains how the song was written about her best friend&rsquo;s grandparents who used to &ldquo;dance their nights away in the working man&rsquo;s clubs of&nbsp;Blackpool&rdquo;. Although the Grandmother passed away, her spouse refused to let the feelings stop him from dancing and, as sang by Rae, &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never stop dancing &lsquo;til he&rsquo;s back with her&rdquo;. The song plays testament to the genuine sentimental connection Morris has with her songs and lyrics. She radiates positivity and happiness throughout her performance, which gives a much more intimate audience to singer connection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As if the set had not already sparked a series of heartfelt emotions in the crowd, Morris finishes an overwhelming set with her title track, &lsquo;Someone Out There&rsquo;. She dedicates the track to BBC Radio 1&rsquo;s Greg James, who has just completed a&nbsp;humongous&nbsp;charitable&nbsp;endeavor&nbsp;to raise money for Sport Relief. Morris explains how he has helped the song become what it truly is, a beacon of light in the campaign to raise awareness of Mental Health illnesses and the stigma that surrounds them. The crowd really connects with this song, applauding Morris as she begins her way into the crowd to&nbsp;socialise&nbsp;with her fans.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mCCklYu3EDU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p>In the seemingly endless world of Pop, Rae Morris has turned up and finally given the genre the irregularity it needs. She is a down to earth, utterly lovely woman who makes music because she wants to let people know about her feelings and her emotions. She hid nothing and left everything she possibly could have on this Glasgow stage, an impressive feat recollecting that this was only one night of a UK wide tour. She has proven to a regular critic of pop music that it really can mean something, and for that I have the utmost respect.</p>\r\n', 124, 1, '2018-03-19 10:27:23', '2018-03-19 10:37:51', 'rae-morris-at-the-art-school-glasgow', 1, NULL, 1);

Currently drumming with them on tour is&nbsp;Hamir Atwal, a respected percussionist in his own right. The band&rsquo;s sound is highly percussive, with clear world-music influences as well as shades of house music in their more recent material, punctuated by Garbus&rsquo; distinctive and powerful vocals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Touring with Tune-Yards currently is the Boogarins, who produced a fantastic warm-up set to an already packed Liquid Rooms. The Brazilian band&rsquo;s psych pop sound got plenty of heads bobbing and they received a hearty and well-deserved cheer from the crowd. If you haven&rsquo;t already come across them, I would highly recommend checking out Boogarins&rsquo; latest album <i>L&aacute; Vem a Morte</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Come 9pm, Tune-Yards unassumingly wander onto the stage, enthusiastically greeted by the crowd, and begin their set with &lsquo;Home&rsquo;. Garbus&rsquo; vocals drift over a stripped back accompaniment from Atwal and Brenner on drums and bass in an atmospheric start to the set. Half way through the track the tempo jumps up and the crowd bursts into life as Garbus makes her way out from behind her microphone to the front of the stage. Following this jump up in energy, the band moves seamlessly from &lsquo;Home&rsquo; onto &lsquo;Look at your hands&rsquo;, &lsquo;ABC 123&rsquo;<i> </i>and &lsquo;Water Fountain&rsquo;. &lsquo;Water Fountain&rsquo;, the band&rsquo;s best-known song, is greeted by a rapturous cheer from the crowd and some vigorous dancing ensues as Garbus demonstrates her highly skilled use of the looping equipment, accompanied by fervent strobe-lighting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;After these first four tracks whip Liquid Rooms up into quite a frenzy, the band takes a moment to pause and say a quick thank you before reining things in a little bit with a beautiful rendition of &lsquo;Powa&rsquo; followed by a return to a higher energy with &lsquo;Colonizer&rsquo;. House music&rsquo;s influence on the band shines through as &lsquo;Colonizer&rsquo; is followed by a hectic acid-house style break, with Atwal and Brenner working together to create a huge sound whilst Garbus crouches over her looping and sampling apparatus, evidently re-programming things for the second half of the set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Garbus conducts the audience through the second half of the set, waving a baton at them in time with tunes from &lsquo;Coast to Coast&rsquo; to &lsquo;Gangsta&rsquo; before stopping to say a thank you to the whole team, giving particular thanks to Fred on the lights who had made the show visually spectacular. The set closed with the opening song from the new album, &lsquo;Heart Attack&rsquo;, although it wasn&rsquo;t long before the band are welcomed back onto the stage following cries of &lsquo;one more song!&rsquo;. The band re-emerges to finish off the set in great style with &lsquo;Bizness&rsquo;<i> </i>followed by the anthemic &lsquo;Free&rsquo;. From start to finish the gig was an excellent exhibition of the band&rsquo;s varied catalogue, transitioning from bare vocals and ukulele into heavy house industrial beats and keeping the audience captivated throughout.</p>\r\n', 36, 1, '2018-03-21 11:30:26', '2018-03-21 18:21:47', 'tune-yards-at-liquid-rooms', 1, NULL, 1),

The <i>Trout Mask Replica </i>or <i>2001: A Space Odyssey </i>veneer of originality of almost invariably applied long after the stamp of excellence has been created by public and critical acceptance. Much of the pre-release discussion of Lynne Ramsay&rsquo;s latest film <i>You Were Never Really Here</i> focused on the comparisons to films like <i>Taxi Driver, Le Samourai, </i>and the more recent&nbsp;<i>Drive</i>, but while these films share narrative and stylistic similarities to both the film version of <i>You Were Never Really Here </i>and Jonathan Ames&rsquo; novella upon which it is based, the editorial approach taken by Ramsay prevents her latest project from becoming hackneyed. In the age of big name, big budget, cinematic-universe event films, the tightly paced and muscular brevity&nbsp;of the film is refreshing, and much needed. As Joaquin Phoenix&rsquo;s Joe lurches through the one of the grimmest depictions of the American east-coast in decades, the picture refuses to stand-on-ceremony, every scene exists to drive Joe, and the viewer, towards the grinding conclusion that is clearly coming. <i>You Were Never Really Here</i> is consciously indebted to Scorsese&rsquo;s blood soaked brothel shootout in <i>Taxi Driver</i>, and the societal degradation and paranoia of <i>Serpico</i>&rsquo;s final d&eacute;nouement in a New York tenement.&nbsp;Intriguingly, Ramsay herself will be the draw for many viewers, as 2011&rsquo;s <i>We Need to Talk About Kevin </i>has drawn a larger and larger following, largely thanks to a lengthy stay on Netflix, to the Scottish director. The other two standout names from the team, Phoenix and Jonny Greenwood&nbsp;are, for all their talent, relatively low key individuals, at least by Hollywood standards, and the film benefits from this; the cinema-go&rsquo;er is saved from the ever-present overacting of the contemporary Hollywood prestige leading man, or needless Oscar seeking post-production additions. The pace and single mindedness of the original novella, at just 92 pages, and the adapted screenplay, do have their drawbacks, as the film speeds past characters and motivations, leaving it up to the viewer to interpret the flashbacks that communicate Joe&rsquo;s wordless internal monologue. Some viewers are certain to be turned off by this technique, as are others by the recurrent physical and sexual violence that make up the bulk of the film.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The promise and premise of the film is enacted in the centrepiece scene, which occurs surprisingly early in the film, as Joe looks to rescue a girl from an underae brothel. Shot almost entirely through CCTV cameras, the silent, unflinching view of Joaquin Phoenix violently dispatching guards on his way to rescue Nina, his job to save her clearly playing second fiddle to his, and the audience&rsquo;s, need for brutal catharsis at the end of a blunt hammer. The reintroduction of dialogue and the return to traditional camerawork comes too early, and separates the film from true auteur cinema, however, the stark simplicity of Lynne Ramsay&rsquo;s vision and trust in her audience. <i>You Were Never Really Here </i>is likely the most challenging mainstream release so far this year, but well worth the investment for those willing to take a more constructive view of the often difficult violence.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><em>You Were Never Really Here</em> is playing at Edinburgh FilmHouse</span></span></p>\r\n', 89, 1, '2018-04-03 18:47:39', '2018-04-03 18:47:39', 'you-were-never-really-here-review', 3, NULL, 0),

It&rsquo;s the hottest day of the year, but the atmosphere within is cool and calm, stirred only lightly by hushed chatter and the whispering flow of lager into pint glasses. There is a certain ease to the crowd which perfectly reflects the intimacy of the night to come, as Rhys Lewis and Declan J. Donovan draw their three-week European tour to a close in one of Glasgow&rsquo;s West End venues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First to grace the stage is Declan J. Donovan, an Essex-born songwriter and singer. Already, the personal nature and intimacy of his music is no secret. His demo<i> Fallen So Young</i> is a best man&rsquo;s speech written to music, which he originally performed for his brother&rsquo;s wedding. He has attributed the inspiration to write his most recent single, <i>The Human Way, </i>to the change of perspective which followed the birth of his nephew. The honesty of his song-writing merges the relationship between performer and audience to almost that of a confession and his confidante; a dynamic enhanced by the spell-bound silence which he casts upon the crowd. It may not be the reaction usually expected form Glaswegian gig-goers, but the mellow crowd makes the perfect companion to the honesty of his set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The evening&rsquo;s head-line act is Rhys Lewis. Another performer of the singer-songwriter variety but no doppelganger of his predecessor on the stage &ndash; often the danger for the stereotyped &ldquo;man-with-acoustic-guitar&rdquo;. His soul-filled stage presence seamlessly moves the vibe from the intimate front-room gig of Donovan to a down-town broken-hearted Blues bar. Indeed, the personal nature of his music is no less intimate, but here the topic is one-track, as he wrenches out the difficulties of heartbreak though the tracks of his EP <i>Bad Timing</i>, released in February. Accompanying his guitar with only a set of keys, a stripped back version of the band he toured with, but perfectly suited to the low-key setting, Lewis&rsquo; voice took centre stage, and resonated nearly as loudly as his lyrics. Highlights of his set included the minimalistic <i>Reasons to Hate You </i>and the border-line ballad of his 2017 single <i>Be Your Man</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The world of the acoustic song-writer can often seem to be a game of &ldquo;Heads you lose, Tails I win&rdquo; where artists struggle between the potential obscurity of the poet, and the cheesy desperation of your dad&rsquo;s cover band. But both Monday night&rsquo;s acts brought out the best that such a genre has to offer, where raw talent and careful artistry work to create a genuine relationship between the performer, his music and its audience. Truly, listening to both Donovan and Lewis feels very much like getting to know them. And if that is the case, then one might wonder if a second date beside the Clyde might bring us a little closer to falling in love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Review&nbsp;Written by Mary Sheard</p>\r\n', 143, 1, '2018-05-18 09:14:03', '2018-05-18 09:14:03', 'declan-j-donovan-and-rhys-lewis-at-swg3-glasgow', 1, NULL, 0),

I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with the bands on the bill making it hard to know what to expect from the night, but when the openers began it was clear what the crowd was in for: dance music. A bit out of place for so early on a Friday night, the crowd swayed along with only a few willing to break out and dance. The openers set the vibe for the night, playing full band alternative fusion and solo performance EDM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sonars hit the stage, a stage covered in equipment. Massive tables of loopers, sythns, and keyboards blocked in Frederick Paysden and Serena Oldrati. This left Paysden just enough space in the corner to jam on his guitar. The electro-psych duo began their set with a long looped track. It is fair to say that from this first song, I was not buying in. The loop seemed to stretch on and I felt lost in the multi-layered music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the next song caught my interest and I was hooked. A looped rhythm section, samples, guitar and synth lines, and just a taste of lyrics; Sonars were captivating. You could feel it in the audience as very few people remained still. There was a motion and rhythm that almost couldn&rsquo;t help but be danced to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Desert Moon started and suddenly there were cheers from the crowd. Paysden and Oldrati looked both shocked and pleased continuing into the song that had everyone interested. Easily my favorite song of the night, it opened with a samples of space exploration recordings. Desert Moon brought a new energy while remaining true to the sound already established by the previous songs. Groovy, spacey, layered, and detailed, the elements were harmonious and the crowd responded excitedly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the show carried on, the crowd continued to dance and Sonars continued to feed us interesting tunes. They kept it serious with minimal on-stage banter and played a near continuous stream of songs. When Paysden did pause to address the audience, he expressed genuine thanks to the crowd, the other bands, and to the venue for the special night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seemed almost too soon when they announced it was their last song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the gig ended and the lights came on, I stood a bit disoriented. Sonars&rsquo; songs had engrossed me and I was not prepared for the release. Coming back to my senses, I quickly reflected that it had been a Friday night well spent. The music from all of the bands was full of interesting and complex instrumentation that could be appreciated by everyone. Sonars played a good set that kept the crowd moving along to it. Overall a night enjoyed.</p>\r\n', 143, 1, '2018-05-31 13:43:29', '2018-05-31 13:43:29', 'sonars-at-sneaky-pete-s', 1, NULL, 0),

Why did you decide to create Date Night?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I created Date Night because I wanted to encapsulate those first pangs of romance, and the playlists and mixtapes you make. A kind of soundtrack to those first butterflies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is the meaning behind the name?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I like the idea of people being drawn to one another at my night.

But for bigger events, I like to bring in others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What kind of style does your DJ bring to the table?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m a stickler for a DJ that plays the classics, maybe more the obscure.&nbsp; It ultimately love what DJ Kiki does for Drugstore Glamour. The atmosphere she creates is incredible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What kind of genres does Date Night play around with?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alot of synth, classic indie, Italian disco, 80s freestyle...but I never plan the night. The crowd dictates the course of the night!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you have a philosophy towards the parties you throw and the atmosphere you create?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get &#39;em sweatin&#39;, get &#39;em winchin&#39;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Which venues do you tend/prefer to play in?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sleazys is an institution and they took a chance on me, and let me host two clubnights with them. I&#39;ve played The Duck, Stereo, Broadcast, most of Edinburgh&#39;s venues too. I loved playing at the Old Fire Station for an after party for Talbot Rice Gallery. I do love playing in spaces that aren&#39;t traditionally venues.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Mash House was transitioning into Mash House, I used to play there. It&#39;s worked hard and invested in awesome promoters, and it&#39;s soaring. I originally wanted to take Date Night there, but was loyal to Sleazys when they sacked a clubnight to make way for mine. But I love what Mash House do, and have been lucky enough to work with Paradigm and Main Ingredient. I prefer venues that get the aesthetics and installations of Date Night.

Expect long hair, glitter beards and a LOT of good music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Festivalgoers are immediately met with mass yoga practice, croquet and volleyball games in full-swing, next to a flurry of rides and food stalls - &nbsp;most notably a chicken stand which could be mistaken as a mini stage, due to the large crowd attracted to its DnB blaring from the speakers. Each attraction and stage encapsulate their own aura. Attendees can intently listen to the low-key, acoustic sounds of Sofar Sound&rsquo;s hand-picked artists (a worldwide collective where you apply for tickets to watchemerging artists perform in a secret location &ndash; click here for the Edinburgh site: <a href=\"https://www.sofarsounds.com/edinburgh\">https://www.sofarsounds.com/edinburgh</a> ) in a bohemian tepee with plush cushions, without being distracted by your typical <i>disco night at Mash House</i> playlists of Diana Ross and CHIC coming from the Chapel of Love &ndash; a small tent hosting an array of glitter clad disco dancers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kopparberg DIY stage is the most charming location on the grounds: a small enclosed stage resembling a boxpark, hosting the likes of the Liverpudlian duo Her&#39;s charming the crowd with languid hits like &lsquo;Cool With You&rsquo;, and finishing the day with the unmistakeably cool rock-tones of Pumarosa<i>. </i>The warm vibe of the festival is made clear across the stages, as anthemic favourites like Honne&rsquo;s &#39;Warm on a Cold Night&#39;<i>&nbsp;</i>and Dermot Kennedy&#39;s raspy passion ring out of the various tents throughout the day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the day goes on, an eclectic mix of stellar artists grace the main stage. As the crowd sits, waiting in anticipation for sultry rockers The Horrors<i>&nbsp;</i>to arrive on the main stage, I speak to two members of the crowd, Ned and Ben, asking them about who they&rsquo;re excited to see. &ldquo;Well, I mean, we saw Tame Impala on the line-up and immediately bought tickets,&rdquo; Ned says. I ask them if they&rsquo;re excited for The Horrors<i>&nbsp;</i>to come on, to which they respond with a confused &ldquo;who?&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crowd continues to grow, watching the wonderful chaos of South London&rsquo;s Fat White Family<i>, </i>culminating in their performance of &#39;Whitest Boy on the Beach&#39;<i>, </i>to the electronic, pixie-like tones of CHVRCHES. Unmistakeably, the key attraction of the day is the hugely coveted headline performance of Tame Impala: a UK exclusive for 2018 after their three-year hiatus, following the 2015 release of their album <i>Currents. </i>As the group runs through hits &#39;Let it Happen&#39; and &#39;Elephant&#39;<i>,</i> alongside constant confetti canons, the excitement only grows, culminating in the crowd favourite &#39;The Less I Know the Better&#39;.&nbsp;What&rsquo;s so spectacular about the scene is the use of neon graphics on screen, blurring out the visuals of the band. This means that the crowd gradually gives up trying to film the set, and whilst their Instagram stories may suffer, the audience is fully immersed in the layered tones of the psychedelic songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Citadel is particularly strong in its recruitment of soul and jazz acts this year. The highlights are clear: the jazz-funk group R+R=NOW,<i> </i>who&rsquo;s set could be understood as an ongoing jam session filled with brass and synth solos; hip-hop/jazz duo Blue Lab Beats<i>&nbsp;</i>whose music resembles a fusion of J. Dilla and John Coltrane; and the subtle tones of legendary jazz-guitarist Kamaal Edwards<i>&nbsp;</i>bring the day to a smooth close. However, the undoubtable star of the day is American born singer Leon Bridges. Defying the critique that his nostalgic style too closely reflects the likes of Sam Cooke amongst other 60s soul singers, Bridges enchants the audience with his slow-dance &#39;Beyond&#39;<i>&nbsp;</i>and upbeat political statement song &#39;Bad, Bad News&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In regards to its female line-up, Citadel has also done particularly well in distancing itself from recent London music festivals. Wireless made the news for having only an astounding three women on its main bill last weekend, whilst Lovebox wasn&rsquo;t particularly successful either. Whilst there&rsquo;s still a way to go, Citadel put itself on the map with Victoria Park&rsquo;s new inhabitants, the female-forward All Points East, hosting acts like the rock-band GOAT, DJ Nabihah Iqbal&#39;s disco-infused set, and French Indie Band,&nbsp;La Femme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a festival where you can enjoy a range of your favourite artists whilst discovering new ones AND you can go home to your own bed at the end of the day (bar the transport <b>MAYHEM </b>on the way home: <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/citadel-festival-complaints-festivalgoers-huge-queues-london-gunnersbury-park-acton-town-2354907\">https://www.nme.com/news/music/citadel-festival-complaints-festivalgoers-huge-queues-london-gunnersbury-park-acton-town-2354907</a> ), Citadel 2019 is the one to watch.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/114/content_Citadel2018.jpg\" style=\"width: 499px; height: 333px;\" />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A word of advice - as the heatwave continues alongside festival season, please remember: Britain you are not immune to the sun and bum-bag tans aren&rsquo;t cute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Link to Citadel&#39;s website here:&nbsp;<!-- x-textbox/html -->http://citadelfestival.com/</p>\r\n', 172, 1, '2018-07-22 12:17:53', '2018-07-23 08:35:21', 'citadel-festival-at-gunnersbury-park-london', 1, NULL, 0),

She compares this to&nbsp;her parents&#39; faith in God with incredible wit. She speaks of coming out to her parents with silly and joyous storytelling. Whilst I wasn&#39;t falling to the ground laughing, her story was&nbsp;compelling and funny.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Catherine clearly has an amazing story to tell, and while it is certainly engaging, it does not always have the biggest punchlines.&nbsp;Yet whilst&nbsp;I did not roar with laughter, I did laugh plenty, and had so much fun hearing Catherine&rsquo;s stories. She is the definition of bubbly, and makes you feel extremely comfortable in her presence. Even&nbsp;when asking the audience awkward questions such as, &quot;Is anyone here bisexual?&quot;, she does so with grace.&nbsp;She finds joy in any response you give;&nbsp;a joy that transcends into the audience and makes you instantaneously like her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Catherine speaks of her family with fondness and an understanding of their flaws. She is never mean-spirited in her jokes and seems only to wish to tell her story with grace and light humour. However, whilst&nbsp;I did enjoy hearing about Catherine&rsquo;s father becoming a deacon, and her frank admission of being hospitalised for four&nbsp;months with&nbsp;OCD, the way that she frames her jokes and punchlines could be better crafted for a bigger laugh. Yet perhaps it is not intended to be a show that leaves the audience incapacitated by laughter; perhaps it is simply meant to be a comfortable way of talking about some uncomfortable issues.&nbsp;Nevertheless, I found this an amusing&nbsp;and educational hour which leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy afterwards.

To be standing in a small basement room in front of a packed audience, is a world away from his usual set up at Mock the Week, Stand Up Central and Absolute Radio. Yet, he has never appeared more at home. Aged 29, his sketch centres around his dating errors, housemate woes, career aspirations and more. From embarrassing sex-stories, hilarious anecdotes of his middle-class upbringing, and his quest to appear more attractive, Moore&rsquo;s sketch is a roller-coaster narrative, bouncing from one topic to the next with ease.

His self-deprecating approach not only created an unquestionable rapport with the audience, enhanced by the small and intimate venue, but made him and his stories all the more relatable. They are punchy and well executed, if not a little too fast-paced at times, sprinkled throughout the narrative without being too overpowering. Moore, unlike many comedians these days, does not try to be controversial or outspoken to garner laughs, but instead pokes-fun at himself, explaining, for example, how he wouldn&rsquo;t survive in prison with his &quot;cherubic features&quot;, creating a comfortable and jolly audience atmosphere.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm\"><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Only being his seventh show of the month, I will not be surprised to see this garner lots of attention.

I will say is that this has to be the most bizarre show that you will ever see.

This felt like an intentional decision on Alderton&rsquo;s part to express Alderton&rsquo;s increasing appearance of madness, or even to confuse the audience into a nervous laughter. Even if it was intentional to mispronounce his words, I personally found it to be a little uncomfortable and would have preferred to be able to simply enjoy his funny voices <i>and </i>know what he was saying.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">One thing Alderton does very well is surprise you.

The Chooky Boys (the 4 dancers that make up <i>Djuki Mala</i>) then come on to stage, performing a traditional Aboriginal dance, set to indigenous music</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly, though, the troupe breaks out into contemporary dance, with booming disco music and bright lights. The tone of the rest of the show is set: gone are the traditional Yolngu dances and music, replaced instead with a range of modern routines and costumes, from a Gene Kelly-esque number, to Motown boogies and a Michael Jackson-inspired tribute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, that&rsquo;s not to say that, after the first dance, the Yolngu spirit is completely lost from the show: quite the opposite. Between each number, videos of the boys and their Elder discussing the troupe&rsquo;s beginnings and their Yolngu culture play, teaching us about their childhoods and history. Perhaps the best thing about each of the dances, too, is that no matter what their style, there&rsquo;s still a thread of Aboriginal character running through each. Whether it&rsquo;s an odd Yolngu-like dance move thrown in here, or a variation of a well-known step there, the Chooky Boys manage to make each routine feel like their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This being said, there is one point where this enriching fusion of cultures feels slightly inappropriate. In one dance, the Chooky Boys don gold turbans and perform a Bollywood style number, which, given the mostly Western audience and lack of Indian performers, did strike a bit of an uncomfortable chord for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rest of the routines, though, were an absolute joy to watch, and that is no doubt largely down to the Chooky Boys&rsquo; dancing skills. They bring a fizzing energy to the stage that never drops throughout the show and, despite their range of choreography, manage to take on each different dance with aplomb. Their movements are sharp and in-sync, and the range of different styles and multiple costume changes means the audience&rsquo;s attention never wavers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The personality of the <em>Djuki Mala</em> performers also shines through in every number. Whether it be an odd wink at the audience or the pulling of a funny face, there&rsquo;s a cheekiness to each of the boys that brings a warmth and relaxed nature to their performance. The audience is left in no doubt when the Elder on the video mentions the comedy that occurs at Yolngu boys&rsquo; initiation ceremonies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a festival dominated by Western theatre and theatre-goers, <i>Djuki Mala </i>brings an important and refreshing cultural spectacle. Its fusion of Western and Yolngu culture seems to reflect the development of Aboriginal culture in Australia today, while the characters of the performers and their fun choreography make it a joy of a show to watch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>Francesca Sellors for Fresh Fringe</em></p>\r\n', 15, 1, '2018-08-12 16:24:11', '2018-08-12 16:24:11', 'djuki-mala', 5, NULL, 0),

Comedian and actress, Lolly Jones, launches into her sensual satire, where she dons the roles of Theresa May, Margret Thatcher, Angela Eagle, Arlene Foster and Nicola Sturgeon.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\">What makes Jones&rsquo; act so special is her impeccable mimicking of the doomed politicians&rsquo; voices. As recordings play on a continual soundtrack, Jones contorts her face and body into each woman. This brings to life the self-serving and meaningless rhetoric of politicians and is a springboard for some superb, if simplistic, dance routines.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\">The real comedy comes from actual recordings of Theresa May. Jones makes her audience hyper aware of the absurdity of May&rsquo;s comments through her voluptuous act. The infamous &lsquo;running through fields of wheat&rsquo; is given new pizazz with sexy dancers shaking wheat. Similarly, May&rsquo;s&nbsp;&#39;girls night in&#39;&nbsp;PR disaster on International Women&rsquo;s Day becomes a whole sequence of daring dressing gown dances.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\">Jones makes May do a painful post-election boogie to Sia&rsquo;s song, Chandelier, and then imagines the first meeting of May and her husband. In a perfect sequence they met at the Cambridge University Conservative Society disco. As Theresa and Philip dance to The Pi&ntilde;a Colada Song, Jones brings miraculous humanity to May&rsquo;s un-relatable sound bites.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\">But the comedy does not stop at May. Jones runs us through the last few years of female political history. A highlight is Thatcher possessing a traumatised Theresa.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\">As Jones changes costumes, Liam Hourican treats the audience to a video cameo as Jacob Rees Mogg. He adds edge to an already superb show, giving Mogg the evil twist needed to propel Jones&rsquo; characters further into the patriarchal political sphere.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\">Although hilarity ensues, Jones is making a serious comment about the incessant questions our female politicians face. May is demeaned by her contemporaries and the press, as she is constantly compared to Thatcher and asked about her shoes. Jones&rsquo; act highlights female politicians unique struggle across the political spectrum.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\">While most of the comedy in &quot;Fifty Shades of May&quot; comes from real sound bites, Jones&rsquo; act makes a powerful statement about how we treat our female politicians. Catch her show for fifty shades of sensual, sexy satire. This is niche burlesque at its best, with more to offer than on brand nipple tassels.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><em><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\">Jane Prinsley for Fresh Fringe</span></span></em></p>\r\n', 15, 1, '2018-08-13 20:01:54', '2018-08-14 12:00:03', 'lolly-jones-fifty-shades-of-may', 5, NULL, 0);

Both girls are very dissatisfied with their day jobs and dream of grandeur and fame.

Knight plays &#39;Elle&#39;, a peculiar girl who&nbsp; pushes her unrealistic hopes and dreams on Mimi; very narrowly destroying both their careers in the process.

While the show in fact ran over by about ten minutes, somewhat defeating the purpose of it, I still found it to be an entertaining and thrilling ride. As you can imagine, the show is incredibly fast paced and keeps your eyes fixed to the stage, out of fear that you may miss a single moment of a trick. Hanlin also includes an education in magic tricks and he shows off just how much of a self-proclaimed &#39;magic nerd&#39;&nbsp;he truly is. For example, he describes different experiences he has had watching other magicians as he grew up, and guides the audience into feeling that same love of magic. He describes how he felt seeing a particular trick and then proceeds to do that same magic trick himself. I was hesitant that I may start to feel his show and tricks to be unoriginal, but Hanlin weaves the old, familiar tricks with his own, new inventions.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Despite it being a completely new show, that even Hanlin admits at times is unpolished, I found &quot;50&quot;&nbsp;to be crafted incredibly well. While the show did run over to about an hour, it is still an amazing achievement. Hanlin has clearly worked incredibly hard to find the right tone for this show. He is sometimes wonderfully funny, and other times very serious, the perfect combination to keep the audience entertained. Most of all, Hanlin is friendly and approachable, which is everything you need an entertainer to be. He is kind to the audience, which makes them want to actively participate, rather than begrudgingly be selected for a trick. Hanlin does not presume the audience should be just as fascinated by magic as he is, yet appears to wish that they leave with an excited and uplifting feeling. I can say for sure that I felt this way for hours after the show ended.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">There are indeed kinks that need working out; timings could be sharper, the tricks easier to see and even a couple felt a tad too easy to predict.

Despite being the sole actor, Dhaenen&rsquo;s performance fills the stage. Convincing and believable, he adopts the role of homo politicus with startling resemblance. His carefully constructed speeches and body language remind audience members of current prominent politicians, including Donald Trump. Many scenes were particularly profound; following a leak of explicit images exposing the protagonist&rsquo;s affair, Dhaenen uses his massive, &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; election image as a physical barrier between himself and the photos, which are being shot at the audience with an air blower. Perhaps the politician uses his perfect image as a defence in itself, or as something to hide behind. Though meaningless political rhetoric if frequently used to indirectly say something meaningful, stark diction also undercuts the script; one line in particular, &ldquo;people want things to change, they don&rsquo;t want to change&rdquo;. Equally, emotional moments pepper the script, reminding the audience that despite his fa&ccedil;ade and scandal, homo politicus is still a human. &nbsp;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-c66624b9-7fff-941c-353f-c19079ace9da\">A walk over to New Town took me to Army @ The Fringe for Komuna//Warszawa&rsquo;s Cezary Goes To War. Four actors and one pianist conduct aerobic military recruitment exercises, live soundtracked by a variety of Polish folk and classical pieces. Yes, it is as surreal and obscure as it sounds. The team behind the show received the Best Artistic Team Award at the 2017 Divine Comedy Festival (Krakow), and their musical talents carry the show through absurdity. Half of the time, the audience were laughing as a result of the actors&rsquo; facial expressions and dancing. The other half seemed to come from giggling. A real contrast in style and content to Unsung, using physical movement and humour to approach a serious topic. </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-c66624b9-7fff-941c-353f-c19079ace9da\">Summerhall&rsquo;s Demonstration Room provided the perfect venue for Elbow Room&rsquo;s Prehistoric, a bolshy and roaring image of the punk music scene in Brisbane, Australia in 1979. The energetic four-strong cast explore themes of civil liberties and resistance in the context of the &lsquo;punk moment&rsquo; under the Queensland&rsquo;s brutal Bjelke-Petersen government and policing. Prehistoric received the Best Performance Award at the Melbourne Fringe Festival; the emphasis on performance must not be understated. Deb, Nick, Pete and Rachel&rsquo;s journey from meeting to forming a band is brought to life by live music and songs interspersed throughout the play. Hilarious and unapologetic, Prehistoric caught and held my attention from start to finish. &nbsp;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-c66624b9-7fff-941c-353f-c19079ace9da\">The dark and cavernous basement of Summerhall is an ideal location for immersive theatre, and Kna&iuml;ve Theatre&rsquo;s War With The Newts. This reimagined production of Karel Capek&rsquo;s dystopian science-fiction satire was engaging from the outset. As the audience walked into the venue, we were congratulated on &lsquo;making it aboard&rsquo;, checked for illnesses and allocated a job (stamped on the arm) based on which colour we identified our mood with at the time. As a green, I was allocated &lsquo;oddjobs&rsquo;, and sneered upon when shown to my seat inside. In my view, War With The Newts is a case of dystopian drama at its best; captivating and immersive from beginning to end. The cast of three flawlessly transitioned between different characters to tell the apocalyptic tale, making great use of physical and digital props to present and crack a fa&ccedil;ade of calmness in a storm of trouble. </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-c66624b9-7fff-941c-353f-c19079ace9da\">In Two Destination Language&rsquo;s Fallen Fruit, writer and performer Katherina Radeva explores her experiences of growing up in communist Bulgaria, and the collapse of communism. The play is full of intricately woven stories and details, including that of a (necessarily) secret lesbian relationship, and the effect of 1989 upon the individual lives of these women. Radeva is energetic and fun on stage, playing up to the image of a young pioneer in the youth wing of the communist party whose uniform she dons. Indeed, this is no mean feat for an 11am show at the end of its full Fringe run. Though at times disjointed, the various storylines are interesting and charming. </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-c66624b9-7fff-941c-353f-c19079ace9da\">Finally, Raw Material&rsquo;s After The Cuts is a satirical piece which considers a NHS-less future, in which ordinary citizens are forced into expensive private healthcare or, in the case of Jim and Agnes, more rudimentary DIY options. The cast of two shared fantastic chemistry together, and were singularly bold and hilarious. Despite the fact that Jim narrates the play, at times the audience wonders whether there is a protagonist at all, with Agnes&rsquo; scathing sarcasm providing the perfect counterbalance. Without wanting to spoil the play entirely, Jim labels himself a &lsquo;fixer&rsquo;, and decides to take matters into his own hands when Agnes falls ill. In this vision of the not-so-distant (or different) future, After The Cuts calls upon past notions of &lsquo;make do and mend&rsquo; in times of hardship. The play balances comedic and thought-provoking scenes perfectly, with direct reference to our present; Agnes concludes that we (the people) let &lsquo;them&rsquo; privatise the NHS, and didn&rsquo;t put up enough of a fight. As with Prehistoric, After The Cuts was staged in Summerhall&rsquo;s Demonstration Room. The inclusive nature of the venue worked equally well as a living room (and makeshift operating theatre) as a stage for live punk music. </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-c66624b9-7fff-941c-353f-c19079ace9da\">Unfortunately, I was not able to see LUNG Theatre&rsquo;s Trojan Horse, which received great critical acclaim for its exploration of Muslim extremism in Birmingham schools. Nevertheless, I can certainly say that my desire to see political theatre was well and truly fulfilled, with the plays above considering political themes in the past, present and future. The quality and variety of shows presented at Summerhall&rsquo;s venues this Fringe did not disappoint, with something for everyone&rsquo;s interests. </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><b>Jelena Sofronijevic for Fresh Fringe.</b></em></p>\r\n', 15, 1, '2018-10-02 12:53:50', '2018-10-02 12:55:21', 'summerhall-fringe-review', 5, NULL, 0),

Fear not though! Help is at hand! A new project introduced here in Edinburgh is attempting to use music to help get people grooving and raise money to support the Scottish Association for Mental Health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new event promoter EML (Edinburgh Music Lovers) is launching itself through a series of upcoming live music events across the city in the upcoming weeks and months. In an attempt to tap into the wealth of artistic diversity and talent here in Edinburgh the company is planning on staging concerts, festivals and live music nights to really showcase the cities musicians. Starting next week (on the 29th September) with a live performance from Colin Stetson, an experimental musician who has ditched life stateside for a wee trip to Scotland, EML are not wasting time in rolling out a programme of events that are bound to appeal to all kinds of music lovers. From East London rappers like Kojey Radical to more local acts, the company&rsquo;s mission is to bring music back to the city. Profits from these events and those that follow are being invested in the charity SAMH (Scottish Association for Mental Health) as the director, and former DJ, Jim Byers notes the ability of music to heal. He uses his own experiences, opening up about past challenges in his life and how music helped him work through them Writing on the company website, Byers says &lsquo; from my dad&rsquo;s suicide when I was 10 to my own struggles with depression&hellip; Music has always helped me and I&rsquo;m hoping it can help others.&rsquo; EML&rsquo;s mission is not only exciting but admirable and no mean feat!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With his past years of experience in the music and PR world, Byers looks like the perfect candidate for this huge undertaking and with a city full of funky artists, groovy grandmas and sensational students there&rsquo;s no better place for doing it! Already with a name for itself as an arty hub, Edinburgh&rsquo;s fringe festival attracts thousands of locals and tourists every year, but what EML will hopefully fill is the gap in the music market. It is not for a lack of talent in the city that Edinburgh is yet to have a festival but restrictions over the years on noise, construction and crowd control has resulted in the stagnation of musical events here in the city. Equally these issues have contributed to the closing down of many iconic city venues, making it even harder to keep the music scene alive and fresh. However, all is not lost! Edinburgh still has a reputation with established club nights and venues like The Mash House, Liquid Rooms and The Usher Hall all offering some great nights. Add to this the revival of other locations such as Leith Theatre, Rose Street Theatre and Old Dr Bells Baths it seems the trend for growth is positive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed there are positive signs for EML everywhere you look with the City Council aiming to work in close collaboration with the company in order to push their projects forward. There has also been backing from legends such as Pete Irvine (the organiser of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Hogmanay as well as other events) and Dougal Perman of The Scottish Music Industry Association; all of which is helping to boost the company&rsquo;s reputation already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not just those in the Music Industry that have come out in support for Byers&rsquo; project, mental health organisations in the country too have shown their backing for the idea. Fiona Lewis, the Corporate Partnerships manager of SAMH has declared her appreciation of the efforts of EML stating &lsquo;Thank you to Edinburgh Music Lovers for standing with SAMH... we are proud to be working closely with [them] and the music industry in raising awareness in mental health.&rsquo; In an era where these issues are really coming to the fore of the public conscious, it is great to feel that projects like EML&rsquo;s are now trying to really facilitate solutions and help the millions of people out there to get back into the groove.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So to the music lovers, secret singstars and terrible dancers of Edinburgh- keep an eye out for EML coming to venues near you soon!!</p>\r\n', 17, 1, '2018-10-03 10:34:05', '2018-10-03 10:34:32', 'feelin-the-healin-vibes', 1, NULL, 1),

After an altercation at Grand Central Station, they are bundled up onto a cargo ship and sent far away before a certain group of mischievous penguins take command of the vessel and end up accidentally depositing the motley crew in Madagascar, where all manner of new experiences are to be found.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAdmittedly, the show took a while to find its feet (with the escapees not arriving in Madagascar until after the interval), but the second act more than made up for it with an abundance of joyous ensemble numbers and a hilarious appearance from King Julien (the reigning ring-tailed lemur, side-splittingly portrayed by Jo Parsons). Matt Terry&rsquo;s understated honey vocals led the show with a quiet and charming confidence, and he was the icing on the cake of a particularly well-cast company.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nUnfortunately, the score itself was largely forgettable, with a few recurring motifs carrying the brunt of the entire musical. It was somewhat disappointing, but the familiarity afforded to it by the film worked to conceal such a creative oversight, and I dare say it would not have fared so well if it did not have the association of its older sibling. Nevertheless, it was clear that those on stage were having a good time, and as a result there was a large grin on my face throughout. &nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nVisually, the production is a colourful feast for the eyes, and Max Humphries&rsquo; puppet design is exceptional.

Performing the band&rsquo;s best-loved hits, this theatre-cum-gig takes the audience back to where it all began and re-lives the best memories.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first half commemorates some of The Beatles&rsquo; most iconic performances &ndash; opening with the 1973 Royal Variety Performance where John Lennon famously told the rich amongst the audience to &lsquo;shake their jewelry&rsquo; - and glides between glorious, equally standout moments (stopping, of course, at the magnificent and ever-radiant Lonely Hearts Club). After the interval, the Beatles join together one final time for the reunion to end all reunions, and play a host of their best-loved hits &ndash; including from solo ventures which emerged post-breakup.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So-termed a &lsquo;jukebox musical&rsquo;, the performers allow the music to speak for itself &ndash; interrupted only by interim audience interaction as they transition between instruments and epochs. A multitude of equally stunning lighting compositions by Sooner Routhier and Robert Long bathed the stage in a sumptuous and atmospheric glow, gloriously erupting in the woozy mellow of Strawberry Fields Forever. Michael Gagliano, in particular, was exceptional as John Lennon, capturing his rebellious nature through every wig change and period of self-growth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tremendous musical ability of all involved was apparent throughout, but the overall production was woven together a little disjointedly. Four cumbersome TV screens around the stage served to provide footage period-appropriate footage &ndash; both of The Beatles&rsquo; performances and of adverts of the time. It was a nice idea but the sparkling gleam of 21st century technology clashed somewhat with the nostalgic and vintage illusion produced on stage. Perhaps a filter added to the live footage of the night would have helped to maintain the impression that this is a pseudo-theatrical performance instead of a tribute band. Furthermore, I felt that the booming voice of the compere before and after the show cheapened what those on stage had worked so hard to produce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, Let It Be is a triumphant celebration of an iconic band. With such an extensive repertoire of timeless classics on which to rely, the production can afford to let the music speak for itself. Excelling in their performances, the cast of <em>Let It Be</em> takes you back to where it all began, and riotously lead us through the defining moments of a still-reigning history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">Let It Be&nbsp;</span></em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">runs at the Edinburgh Playhouse until Saturday 13th October 2018.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2018-10-09 15:19:59', '2018-10-10 14:15:23', 'let-it-be-review', 3, NULL, 1),

She has a wedding to attend, and it will be a welcome opportunity to leave the stress of her newfound motherhood behind. Except her mother Margaret wasn&rsquo;t born yesterday and locks them both in the bathroom until the ferry leaves &ndash; it seems &lsquo;wedding&rsquo; is a strange term for political activism in the Arctic that serves to destroy oil rigs in its waters, and Margaret does not approve.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspired by the 2013 arrests of 30 Greenpeace activists who boarded an Arctic oil rig in protest, Clare Duffy&rsquo;s nuanced script elegantly explores the conflict between ethical and pragmatic duties. Ella wants to change the world so that her son can grow up in a better place, but Margaret is more concerned that Ella remains a part of it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An unflinching look at family dynamic, Duffy&rsquo;s script excels in understanding the human psyche. Presenting a rich and multithreaded private background, Jennifer Black&rsquo;s Margaret and her calm fa&ccedil;ade work well in contrast with the genuine desperation of Neshla Caplan&rsquo;s Ella. Gareth Nicholls&rsquo; direction places a well-placed focus on maintaining familial normality in an otherwise unconventional situation, and moments of tension are emphasised by a careful framework of peaks and troughs throughout &ndash; even if some of the friction did originate from a somewhat incongruous subplot involving the father of Ella&rsquo;s baby and a sabotaged mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A well-grounded and thought-provoking piece, <em>Arctic Oil</em> captures the essence of familial frictions within the structure of wider duties.

On a Wednesday evening, 10th October, entering Glasgow&rsquo;s The Garage, the crowd doesn&rsquo;t seem phased by this departure; the show was even sold out. There is excitement laced between the nightclub/venue as murmurs are heard throughout the crowd about the night ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Story So Far takes the stage at 8pm exactly. The melodic twang of guitars introduces the first couple songs of &lsquo;Nerve and &lsquo;Proper Dose&rsquo;&rsquo;: and in the first four bars of the song a mosh pit develops. &nbsp;A collective cheer after this high-energy opening almost drowns out frontman Cannon&rsquo;s thanking of everyone to be here. The audience mouths move, demonstrating the hours devoted to memorisation. A chant begins &nbsp;(&ldquo;The Story So Far&rdquo;) after; the audience asserts themselves as a collective community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&lsquo;Things I can&rsquo;t change&rsquo;, from their second album, begins giving off an anthem-like quality. It overshadows the last two songs; the building&rsquo;s voices almost drown the microphoned Cannon, who punches the air, leading them on. The two guitarists keeping to the edge of the stage as &lsquo;All wrong&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Glass&rsquo;, &lsquo;Let it go&rsquo;, &lsquo;Heavy Gloom&rsquo;, &lsquo;Keep this up&rsquo; continue the show. Cannon thanks the crowd with genuity again. &lsquo;Singing now feels good&rsquo;, &lsquo;Drink safe, Drink safe&rsquo; are other small positivities are said in between the songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Proper Dose&rsquo;s leading single &lsquo;Upside Down&rsquo; - is partly overshadowed by the roaring of &lsquo;Roam&rsquo; playing directly after.The entire room jumps in time and with the audience involvement with overpowering lyrical tones and two mosh-pits seeming to be opening up; the resonance of their older songs are evident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With a glance, the crowd who seems to largely be in their mid-20s suggests these could be loyal fans from when The Story So Far&rsquo;s original albums came out in 2011-12. Perhaps then linking it with the common belief of Pop Punk being branded as &ldquo;dead&rdquo; in 2018. The days of My Chemical Romance and Green Day are over, and perhaps the fans are only there for the older pop punk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yet, the chant for an encore after the final bars of &ldquo;Quicksand&rdquo; is deafening. And as The Story so Far&rsquo;s most successful song &lsquo;clairvoyant&rsquo;&rsquo;s tuneful acoustic guitar plays, the room changes tone; under the white stage lights couples embrace each other, phones are out filming and members of the crowd climb onto others shoulders. The chorus&rsquo;s mantra of &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t paint me black when I used to be golden&rdquo; ends the set with the same vitality that started it: yet this time on a softer note. The cheers after the show ending go on for long after the band exits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yes, the eldest songs proved the most lively. But, the concert never dipped further than this. In recent years the pop-punk scene has not hold as much prevalence as it once did, but this show seemed pretty alive. Cannon&rsquo;s leadership of the show paid off with intense audience immersion proved a special dedication of both audience and band for an experience. Perhaps loyal fans overshadow the loss of a scene.</p>\r\n', 190, 1, '2018-10-17 20:22:09', '2018-10-22 13:26:21', 'the-story-so-far-at-the-garage-glasgow', 1, NULL, 1),

Bourne is, at his heart a storyteller; who builds upon traditional choreography with embellishments of contemporary, characterful movement. Removing ballet from its stereotype as a form available only within the remit of the well-afforded upper classes, Bourne opens up the discipline to wider society and ensures there is something for all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the core of this world-renowned adaptation is the creation of an all-male swan ensemble &ndash; a decision that subverts the traditionally heteronormative encounter between the Prince and the Swan into a same-sex liaison; in whatever semblance personal interpretation may permit. Underscoring the entire production with a muscular elegance, this creative decision remains to this day as iconic as it has ever been. Making an unforgettable entrance at the lakeside - where the Prince had gone at his wits end with the intent to end his suffering - the bevy of swans storm the stage from all angles, dominating the land with their threatening aggression and untamable beauty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lez Bretherston&rsquo;s design beautifully accompanies the production, helping to whisk the audience away into far and distant lands without being gimmicky.

The audience are allowed to hear these songs, so familiar to them but only on the terms that they are to be cut before anyone gets too comfortable. Its purpose is to say, yes you may have seen and heard some of this before, as the play deals with the hardly untrodden story of a girl who&rsquo;s been recently sectioned, but we are assured not to be stilled just quite yet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSet in a Psychiatric Ward in Lewishman, Michael Hajiantonis&rsquo; <em>Going Slightly Mad</em>&nbsp;follows the story of mad Max, played with a feral ferocity by Lizzie Lewis, as she comes to terms with her surroundings and the people that inhabit it. First up there&rsquo;s cynical Anna and the harmless, lovable Joey, played off against one another brilliantly by Tilly Botsford and Charlie O&rsquo;Brien. Later on we meet local boy Leon (Levi Mattey) and the mute Irish James (Amelia Watson).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe play works at its best when all the actors are on stage, which you find happens a lot with the directors Michael Hajiantonis and Sophie Smith truly make the most of their talented cast. No one is underexploited, with each character, bar Max, finding themselves in no less than three other roles.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe script is sharp and very funny, after all depression doesn&rsquo;t have to be depressing - and considering the strangeness and chaos of the situation, you&rsquo;d have to be mad not to find some humour in it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe play only suffers when it struggles to maintain the momentum into the second half, which the writer and directors attempt to resolve through a bizarre and unnecessary fourth-wall breaking scene. Leon confronts the audience to address what we&rsquo;ve all been thinking: &lsquo;why am I being forced to sit in this <em>People, Places and Things</em>-cum-<em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest</em> student knockoff?&rsquo; However, I doubt many people had been thinking this.

As is so often the case in Shakespeare productions, the speech often felt as though it was being read out across the stage, with little sense of a relationship either between characters or between words. This aspect was particularly disappointing, especially when considering Norris&rsquo; desire to spark interest in younger audiences &mdash; how can students of Macbeth be expected to engage if they can&rsquo;t follow the reasoning and conflict within each character? To me, this was a significant area of weakness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet many aspects of the production were good. Despite the lack of fluidity, some performances stood out. Lady Macbeth&rsquo;s role was done justice, especially in her last speech; Rachel Sanders&rsquo; Ross was a pleasure to watch. The contrast between Macbeth&rsquo;s gruff exterior and his vulnerability was effectively expressed in his &nbsp;soliloquies, and across the entire cast there were specific lines which were powerfully delivered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visually, the production was promising; the setting was well-captured by the military costume design the set, which was dark and grimy, reminiscent of an army bunker. Norris opted for a post-apocalyptic setting, which suited the starkness of the play, and also served to highlight the relevance of Macbeth to the modern world. The setting enhanced the plot by its attention to camaraderie, which served to make the regicide more unsettling, a difficult aspect to capture in a world that no longer depends on stable monarchy. However, it also created an undertone of excessive masculinity, which both complimented the primitive violence of Macbeth and was an effective addition to Shakespeare&rsquo;s examination of gender.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I was most looking forward to, though, was the atmosphere. On a windy autumn night in Scotland, watching a production of Macbeth seemed perfectly fitting. And initially, the atmosphere Norris created suited the play; the three witches, pale against the dark backdrop, brought a haunting quality to the stage with a classically horror film aesthetic (I was reminded of Robert Eggers&rsquo; The Witch, in terms of visuals and audio). But as the play progressed, the mood was lost, and the genre seemed to flicker &mdash; what had at first been supernatural became almost like a drama. There was an attempt to restore the eeriness at the end, but by then the tension was lost and the damage was done, and the result was an ending that was neither powerful nor pathetic. In a sense, the great frustration with this play is not that it was bad, but that it wasn&rsquo;t incredible, which perhaps it could have been.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But did Norris manage to engage his audience, as intended? Overall, yes. While the execution of the production did not do it justice, suffering from a lack of consistency and natural flow, the play was neither stiff nor excessively academic. Norris&rsquo; production was stimulating, fresh, and entertaining &mdash; worth the watch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\"><em>National Theatre&#39;s Macbeth</em> runs at the Festival Theatre until Saturday 27th October 2018.</span></p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2018-10-24 23:52:39', '2018-10-24 23:52:39', 'national-theatre-s-macbeth-review', 3, NULL, 1),

Navigating the tricky waters of family tensions, pregnancy and the breadline is no easy task, but Tony discovers the possibility of independence through the prize money of an upcoming dance competition, and sets about trying to make his dream a reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holding so much of the plot on his back individually, Richard Winsor has a daunting challenge in playing Tony Manero. With an impressive background in dance he excels throughout the musical numbers, but in trying to embody the iconic charisma of John Travolta he is never able to truly come into his own and make his mark on Manero&rsquo;s characterisation &ndash; instead, he is forced to confine his physicality into an awkward recreation of caricature. Consequentially, many of the more emotional by-lines are muted through frictions of this conflict of representation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Set to the music of the Bee Gees &ndash; brilliant portrayed by Edward Handoll, Alastair Hill and Matt Faull on a raised gangway upstage &ndash; the production holds a certain charm but is ultimately deflated by clunky direction. An unnecessary number of scene changes frequently plunge the stage into blackout, which halt any flow before it has a chance to get started. There are also inconsistencies within the pacing of the script &ndash; a number of the more serious plot threads are denied the stage-time needed to be resolved coherently &ndash; in particular, the suicide of Tony Manero&rsquo;s friend, Bobbie C, and its aftermath seemed trivial; given no more than a passing glance before the glitzy finale.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, a general sense of coherence is stitched throughout the production by Bill Deamer&rsquo;s large, flashy choreography of the larger dance routines. Combined with an excess of glitter balls, his era-appropriate routines showcase the evident talent of the ensemble, and serves as welcome highlights to an otherwise ill-conceived narrative. Aided by the fame of the Bee Gee&rsquo;s score, <em>Saturday Night Fever</em> is accessible to younger generations who may not have the seen the film, and consequentially is able to stand in its own terms as a theatrical piece rather than a live representation of cult cinematography. An enjoyable performance - You Should be Dancing in no time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\"><em>Saturday Night Fever</em> runs at the Edinburgh Playhouse until Saturday 27th October 2018.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2018-10-25 12:10:01', '2018-10-25 12:10:01', 'saturday-night-fever-review', 3, NULL, 1),

Whilst separated by time and space, the three by-lines are interwoven through universal themes of wartime horror, and question whether or not someone ever truly can return from a conflict zone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technically, Andrzej Goulding&rsquo;s production design is exceptional. Located in and around a rotating shipping container, projection and carefully-planned adjustments to the container&rsquo;s walls locate the piece smoothly and dynamically through different spheres of spatiality. In addition, sound design by Pete Malkin and lighting design by Zoe Spurr work harmoniously - both to aid the narrative and to disorientate the audience at times of intentional confusion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Anna Jordan&rsquo;s script is intelligent in its triadic presentation, it relies heavily on the use of stereotype in its characterisation. As a result, characters are one-dimensional and lack a human familiarity from which the largely emotional narrative would have benefitted. For example, the present-day soldier is shunned by his community for his ill-justified violence towards Afghan citizens on duty, and a reporter casually suggests that perhaps the hostility towards him had in fact been facilitated by the Islamic Centre. It is a fleeting yet unhelpful comment that serves to exemplify a lack of nuance in the wider plot and in the current political context of wartime rhetoric.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where the production excels, however, is in the well-conceived blend of theatrical techniques for which Frantic Assembly is best known. A particularly memorable scene saw the horrors of shell-shock and the onset post-traumatic stress disorder manifest themselves within Great War veteran George, portrayed sensitively by Jared Garfield. In true Frantic Assembly style, the wider ensemble of three further actors utilised physicality and a vivid use of wider stimuli to represent his suffering, with its non-verbal and interpretative nature affording the audience to formulate their own sense of his suffering individually, drawing on their own framework of toxic emotions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Unreturning</em> explores the human elements of war; developing three cross-sections of varying experiences and formulating them through an emotive lens. Though aided by clever use of technology, the overarching narrative is undone by under-developed and stereotyped representations - a powerful statement about humanitarian tensions that remains unsatisfying in its execution. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">The Unreturning&nbsp;</span></em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">runs at the Traverse Theatre until Saturday 27th October 2018.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2018-10-25 14:23:56', '2018-10-25 14:23:56', 'the-unreturning-review', 3, NULL, 1),

As I stumble lost through Glasgow I am very conscious of the fact that the 8:30 start of IDLES set is quickly approaching. When I near Queen Margaret Union its not google maps that lead me to the venue, it&rsquo;s the booming sound of IDLES&rsquo; opening song that is filling campus. I ran towards it like a moth to a lamp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the first song the gig is on fire. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like the start; the crowd of mostly twenty to fifty year old men is hype and singing along already. I get stuck in the back. I can&rsquo;t see the stage but the crowd is pulsing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IDLES tear through tracks. With the end of one quickly comes the start of the next. No one misses a beat. Everywhere people are embracing, singing to each other, jumping, dancing, crowd surfing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the scream &ldquo;I am a feminist!&rdquo;, IDLES launches into &lsquo;Mother&rsquo;. Social and political commentary come between many tracks along with thank you&rsquo;s to the crowd and the security guards catching the onslaught of crowd surfers. The political messages fuel the crowd, the energy of a like-minded group fed with the frustrations of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crowd leaps as &lsquo;Danny Nedelko&rsquo; and &lsquo;Divide &amp; Conquer&rsquo; come up in the set list. Announcing &ldquo;without you we are f**king nothing&rdquo;, the band pulls members of the crowd onto the stage. Only insanity ensues. Singer Joe Talbot pushes off hangers on, but accepts what appears to be a very heartfelt fan hug. When it&rsquo;s time to get the fans off stage the task is not easy, but eventually everyone trickles off and the gig jumps straight back in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Claiming encores are for idiots, IDLES announce their last song. Talbot does his part, says thanks and leaves the stage. The rest of the band carries on with face melting musical mayhem. Guitarist Mark Bowen brandishes the mic but only for screaming into. Full of noise and energy, suddenly the music cuts, the lights go out, and the band leaves the stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As promised there was no encore. This show was one of the best shows I have seen in years. Every single person left drenched in sweat and with a smile on their face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a massive fan of classic 1970&rsquo;s punk. That causes me to be a skeptic about almost all new bands that label themselves as punk. I put them under a microscope and compare them to the likes of the Modern Lovers and the Clash. Few, if any, have filled the requirements that I believe it takes to be a true punk band. IDLES is one of the few.

It is difficult summarise the plot properly, because for a large proportion of the play, nothing quite happens beyond the conversations between Rooster and the visitors that come by him. Having said that, there is no point where there is any space for the audience to be bored &mdash; on the contrary, the dialogue is so vivid and quick-witted that watching the play, even in the long stretches where the plot slowed down, was a pleasure. That is an impressive feat, considering the fact that <em>Jerusalem</em> is an absolutely huge work, with a running time of two hours and forty-five minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of the play&rsquo;s merit rests on the depiction of Rooster, the central role. He is an unconventional Byronic hero &mdash; coarse, crude, yet somehow charming and difficult not to like, despite his status as a drug dealer to local children. Needless to say, this combination must have made for a challenging role, but actor Paddy Echlin rose to it (although his strange gait, whether a limp or a Jack Sparrow imitation, was sometimes a little grating). Not only was little of Rooster&rsquo;s charm lost, but there was a good transition between the lighter aspects of the character and the more serious, which became apparent with the powerful conclusion of the play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some other notable performances include those by Rufus Love&#39;s Ginger, who often made the audience laugh, and Callum Pope&#39;s Professor, who, though comically opposite to most other characters on stage, delivered a fascinating monologue towards the end. In general, the acting in the play was decent &mdash; where there were areas of weakness, it was made up for by the dynamic nature of the characters and their relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also enjoyed the set design by Bryn Jones and Matthew Marsland. Although it was the script rather than the set which explained that the play took place in the woods, there was a sense of the outdoors, and there was an atmosphere perfectly fitting to the play. The set looked so much like where a man like Rooster would live &mdash; a battered sofa took centre stage, the broken television at the side, and an array of bottles of varying emptiness scattered throughout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But cast and production team alike had the distinct advantage of an absolutely fantastic script. Funny, delightful and simultaneously thought-provoking, <em>Jerusalem</em> is a perceptive update of our views towards nature, Romanticism, and what it means to be English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">Jerusalem&nbsp;</span></em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">runs at Bedlam Theatre until Saturday 27th October 2018.</span></p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2018-10-27 15:01:56', '2018-10-27 15:01:56', 'jerusalem-review', 3, NULL, 1),

The SWG3 Studio Warehouse was a fitting venue for the gig, and I was pleasantly surprised by the diverse age range of the crowd, evidence of Snail Mail&rsquo;s critical acclaim and prominence that has resonated with so many music fans in such a short period of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite transforming into a four-piece ensemble for live performances, Snail Mail is the indie rock solo project of Maryland singer-songwriter Lindsay Jordan, who has been described as &ldquo;the wisest teenage indie rocker we know&rdquo; by Pitchfork, and a &ldquo;prodigy&rdquo; by Billboard.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snail Mail captured our attention from the very first second, rolling into a lyricless, sprawling intro flooded with high-pitched squealing guitar effects, which then transitioned into the opening song, Heat Wave. One thing is for certain, Lindsay Jordan oozes authenticity and a sense of sincerity, and her captivating stage presence instantly draws you in, emanating an air of effortless cool. Jordan&rsquo;s lyrics are hugely emotive and forthright, yet never verge on melodramatic or over sentimental. She invites the listener into the moment with her then swiftly pushes you along before you become too caught up in your feelings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, the entirety of the gig was riddled with technical difficulties, and the band struggled profusely to hear themselves through their feedback monitors from start to finish. It was a frustration for everyone in the room, and at times bordered on distracting, as the musicians grew evidently more irritated throughout each song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was during the final three songs though, that Snail Mail proved just how supremely skilled and exceptional Lindsay Jordan and her solo project truly is. Unsurprisingly, when the warm, opening chords of &lsquo;Pristine&rsquo; (one of Snail Mail&rsquo;s most popular tracks) graced our ears, the crowd&rsquo;s energy level spiked, and a unification between spectator and performer emerged for those precious few minutes. Singing along to every lyric, it felt like this was the crowd&rsquo;s gesture of gratitude towards Jordan and her band, this being their first ever gig in Glasgow. Halfway through the penultimate song, &lsquo;Deep Sea&rsquo;, the frontwoman sunk her teeth into a sensational guitar solo, which sent many of us into a frenzy of applause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the most rewarding moment of the night occurred during the final song, &lsquo;Anytime&rsquo;, when the band members exited the stage, leaving Lindsay Jordan front and centre, with only her guitar and vocals soaking up every corner of the Warehouse. The crowd fell quiet, absorbing every rising and falling melody and every breath, as the electrifying voice of Lindsay Jordan sent us on our way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snail Mail gave an honest, captivating performance, and their motivation to make the best of trying technical circumstances was a testament to the group&rsquo;s work ethic and level of professionalism. This is a band with considerable musical maturity and their &lsquo;rough around the edges&rsquo; approach to indie rock makes them an extremely exciting prospect. I am very much looking forward to wherever Snail Mail takes us next.</p>\r\n', 231, 1, '2018-10-28 16:26:28', '2018-10-28 16:26:28', 'snail-mail-at-swg3-glasgow', 1, NULL, 0),

The crowd seem to share this, as the room grows increasingly warm with every breath of expectation, and there seems to be a lot of expectation. Perhaps best known for fronting britpop trio Supergrass, Gaz Coombes&rsquo; solo career seems to be heavily pushed by his musical past, an assumption made by guessing the average age of the crowd to be around 45. Yet, the blue lights flash on and excitement ensues. The small stage is crowded with an array of interesting-looking instruments, leaving a lot for the eyes to unpack. One by one each band member walks on greeted with love from the audience and we begin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first song is the self-titled &lsquo;World&rsquo;s Strongest Man&rsquo;, making a poignant statement with lyrics like &ldquo;I wanna be by myself, don&rsquo;t leave me by myself&rdquo;. The irony of the name becomes apparent and suddenly a new layer seems to be revealed to his music, a sense of vulnerability. With each song, this becomes clearer; he talks of his daughter with autism and, as he introduces it, &ldquo;a song about bad habits&rdquo;, referring to &lsquo;Sh*t, (I&rsquo;ve done it again)&rsquo;. The more human he shows himself to be&nbsp;the more the crowd love him, greeting each finish with verbal embrace. It becomes clear that his music speaks to these people, whether it&rsquo;s through their nostalgia of the past or the empathy they have for the experiences he sings of; it feels&nbsp;empowering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bass is magnetic, each song boasts powerful riffs and dissonant chords. Coupled with an electric on-stage chemistry between the musicians and a unique use of sampling and looping, the experience is sonically intriguing. But something seems to fall short, in particular, the use of build-ups that never fully pay off. Standing in this muggy&nbsp;underground room, patience is more a virtue than ever. When dissected, each musician seems to play to perfection but the songs drag on and leave the crowd somewhat underwhelmed. It feels more like people are here to see Gaz than fully immerse themselves in the music.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we near the end of the set, mild chaos unravels as two members of the crowd collapse, presumably from the heat of the room. Gaz remains calm and sincere in asking if they&rsquo;re okay, calling for help and passing out water to the crowd. Aside from someone possibly getting hit on the head with a rogue water bottle, the only effect of such disruption seems to be a deeper appreciation for Gaz himself, the crowd cheering as he resumes after making sure all is well. Comically, he takes another hit as the drum machine falters, causing them to restart the song but still, no loss of love. These people seem to truly look up to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With such an impressive voice and solid fanbase, the show was sold out, performing live should be a musical climax. Whilst&nbsp;I left feeling connected to Coombes as a fellow human, I felt his album&rsquo;s complex themes were slightly undermined by the live performance, as the experimental nature of his songs and long setlist created mild agitation in the crowd when combined with sweaty surroundings and several mishaps. There were, however, insanely powerful parts to his set, and his ability to perform excellently despite slip-ups was extremely admirable. I was also moved by how much his music clearly meant to so many people, and the originality it has maintained after a musical career of over 20 years.</p>\r\n', 277, 1, '2018-10-29 18:38:36', '2018-10-29 18:39:08', 'gaz-coombes-at-the-liquid-room', 1, NULL, 0),

Since the creation of the famed monster, there&nbsp;have been countless adaptations,&nbsp;portrayals, and amendments made to this cultural icon, many of which are so divergent from the&nbsp;original to as barely&nbsp;resemble it. However, this production of the time-honored classic does much to stay true to its source material, attempting to recapture much of the&nbsp;horror and mystery that had previously escaped due to the cultural ubiquitousness of the subject matter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, the play is quite successful in its attempts to do so. The set is austere, and though it&nbsp;undergoes many changes of scenery throughout the&nbsp;production, it does much to create a&nbsp;pervasive atmosphere that benefits the horrific subject matter on display. The augmentation of&nbsp;the stage with&nbsp;specialist elements - such as flashing lights and and sound effects - is equally&nbsp;satisfying, and is used with enough reserve to render it truly impactful when&nbsp;it needs to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Likewise, the performances on stage are compelling. The reserved central characters contrast&nbsp;well with the bestial movements of the vampires. Special&nbsp;commendation is due for Cheryl&nbsp;Campbell&rsquo;s portrayal of Renfield, who&rsquo;s crazed antics are undoubtedly a highlight.&nbsp;The primary issues with this play come&nbsp;from the source material, and the associated&nbsp;difficult task&nbsp;anyone faces in rendering the classic for a modern audience. The story in the first half, as in the&nbsp;novel,&nbsp;consists of overlapping time lines and locations, that, though cleverly played out, may be&nbsp;found by some viewers as confusing, particularly if they are not familiar with the source&nbsp;material. Similarly, the later half of the play condenses much of Stoker&rsquo;s work, cutting out many&nbsp;superlative elements, such as&nbsp;explanations of vampire lore, as the production rightly assumes&nbsp;these to be culturally engrained enough so as not to warrant a rehashing for the&nbsp;audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, some narrative elements during this second act are similarly omitted or glossed over so&nbsp;as to render it a rushed feeling, that, though it corrects&nbsp;the drawn out nature of the novel, may&nbsp;move ahead of some viewers without adequate explanation. Also, as a result of the source&nbsp;material, there persist&nbsp;antiquated themes of female sexual impurity, though these might be&nbsp;forgiven due to their importance to the plot. However, the place where this play most succeeds, is&nbsp;in reviving much of the horror and mystery that has been lost from its titular character. Glen&nbsp;Fox&rsquo;s turn as Dracula is foreboding, and his&nbsp;bombastic acting, combined well with special&nbsp;effects, makes the vampire terrifying. And for that reason alone, this play is well worth a view,&nbsp;especially in keeping with the spirit of the season -&nbsp;Happy Halloween.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">Bram Stoker&#39;s Dracula&nbsp;</span></i><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">runs at the King&#39;s Theatre until Saturday 3rd November 2018.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2018-11-01 00:49:40', '2018-11-01 00:49:40', 'bram-stoker-s-dracula-review', NULL, NULL, 1),

Guitars are tuned and the stage is set up. The tones coming from the instruments are immediately recognizable. The crowd anxiously awaits Lucy Dacus. When she takes the stage she is solo. Beginning with a brand new song, Dacus maintains the light hearted threats from the opening act Fenne Lily to deter the crowd from recording this unheard tune. The crowd is quickly enchanted. Dacus, with her unassuming presence and booming voice, grabs everyone&rsquo;s attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immediately after the first song is over, Dacus is joined by a smiley three piece band: guitarist Jacob Blizzard, bassist Dominic Angelella, and drummer Ricardo Lagomasino. Dacus recounts her last show in Glasgow with fondness, and says today has been just as good of a day. Track after track the band goes through <i>Historian, </i>Dacus&rsquo;s most recent solo album. A few songs in Dacus comments on how it is not her newest album. Getting flushed she can not help but bring up her &lsquo;collective baby&rsquo;, boygenius&rsquo; new self-titled EP. Dacus mentions she did not know if she was going to talk about it at this show, but it seems to explode out of her. Obviously excited and proud, she sweetly smiles and the crowd cheers in response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are only three tracks all night that are not off of <i>Historian</i>, but the crowd keeps up with every song played. There are voices singing along on every track, but the big crowd response comes from &lsquo;Addictions&rsquo;. Dacus comments multiple times with her appreciation of the crowd&rsquo;s involvement, stating it makes it more fun for her. There is no doubt that the crowd is invested in every word Dacus&rsquo;s sings. Some songs are explained, while others are gone into without so much as a breath between songs. The most touching of explanations comes at the beginning of &lsquo;Pilar of Truth&rsquo;, as Dacus explains that this is a song about her grandmother&rsquo;s passing. Through all of it, the crowd is engrossed in the show. Most members of the audience have their eyes so intensely locked onto the stage, encapsulated by the magic that seems to be flowing from Dacus herself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The show has been beautiful, deeply moving and all engrossing. When it comes to a close, Dacus&nbsp;ends on a performance of &lsquo;Historians&rsquo;. The Angelella and Lagomasino leave the stage, only Dacus and Blizzard stay for the final song. The guitar is loud and Dacus&rsquo;s voice is deeply soulful. The song ends, Dacus says her thankyous and promptly leaves the stage. Just like that the show is over. The connection is cut and the crowd is left to emotionally sober up in a suddenly light and bustling room. Stepping out into the cold night after the show is welcomed as a way of waking up from the trance we had all been sung into. After an absolutely incredible and personal show, we are left alone on a cold Friday night in Glasgow.</p>\r\n', 143, 1, '2018-11-01 20:30:45', '2018-11-01 20:30:45', 'lucy-dacus-at-mono-glasgow', 1, NULL, 0),
(133, 'GIRLI at The Mash House', 'GIRLI delivers an energetic and youthful performance at The Mash House that leaves the floor literally bouncing...', '<p><!-- x-textbox/html -->Whilst this is not her first tour, Saturday 20<sup>th</sup> October marks 20-year-old singer, songwriter and rapper GIRLI&rsquo;s first gig in Edinburgh, and the Mash House with its ace acoustics and intimate vibe seems to be a perfect setting for her debut here. After the crowd are thoroughly warmed up by the fantastic Jerry Williams (who performs a particularly touching track about an alcoholic she met in a bar), GIRLI (real name Milly Toomey) and her accompanist DJ Kitty appear, starting their nearly hour long set with an &nbsp;unexpected choice of track; &lsquo;Can I Say Baby&rsquo;, taken off of the artist&rsquo;s 2017 <i>Hot Mess</i> EP. GIRLI&rsquo;s trademark youthful energy is clear from the outset, although it takes the also predominantly young crowd until the second song; &lsquo;Play It Cool&rsquo; to really begin to loosen up, and it is only here that we can feel the floor of the Mash House start to bounce &ndash; a sure sign that something good is happening on the stage. Unusually for a singer, GIRLI seems just as well received whether singing or speaking, and it is her highly politicised inter-song patter that really distinguishes her from other artists, giving an impression that she is well-beyond her years in terms of social awareness. GIRLI&rsquo;s more playful side is also clear, particularly during one of her unreleased songs &lsquo;Pink&rsquo;, which the artist tells us is about &lsquo;playing the people that try to play you&rsquo;. Despite what the song title &lsquo;F**k Right Back Off To LA&rsquo; might suggest, the atmosphere in the Mash House is wholly inclusive, with GIRLI telling the audience that she has brought &lsquo;Gender Neutral&rsquo; signs to place onto every toilet in the venue; a small but well thought out (and well received) touch. This is not the extent of GIRLI&rsquo;s connection with the sorts of issues that face young people today, however, as exemplified by her song &lsquo;Up And Down&rsquo;, before which she tells us about her own struggle with mood swings. Despite this important topic, GIRLI still manages to maintain her immense energy, with a soaring high note in the chorus that is truly spectacular. Other highlights include &lsquo;Young&rsquo;, GIRLI&rsquo;s latest single, where she leaves the stage and parties with the audience, truly reflecting that whilst indeed sometimes it &lsquo;hurts to be young&rsquo;, it can also be the time of your life. The performance is not perfect, but even a few forgotten lyrics cannot dampen the exhilarated mood of the crowd, and GIRLI&rsquo;s profuse apologies, blaming her first night nerves, only serve to endear us to her even more. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a GIRLI show without perhaps her most high-octane track &lsquo;Hot Mess&rsquo;, which she performs last, with a spectacular crowd surfing finale that goes to show that, even though (by her own confession) GIRLI is moving in a more poppy direction, she still retains the youthful &lsquo;rockstar&rsquo; persona that her fans know and love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/143/content_girli.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 595px;\" /></p>\r\n', 209, 1, '2018-11-01 22:08:34', '2018-11-01 22:16:18', 'girli-at-the-mash-house', 1, 280, 0),

Meredydd Barker&rsquo;s script utilizes an overarching emphasis on metaphor and superlative discourse, which seemed rather incongruous against the setting of Nye and Jennie&rsquo;s private residence. Excessive over-indulgence in linguistic and literary techniques produced a monotonous and stagnant rhythm to the detriment of the overall narrative, which perhaps could have been substituted for the intimate and variant nuances of naturalistic communication. Accelerated progressions in time throughout the play were indicated by awkward periods of era-appropriate music and dance &ndash; in which the lacking chemistry between actors Gareth John Bale and Louise Collins (Nye and Jennie, respectively) became ever more apparent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, Hristo Takov&rsquo;s lighting design aimed to reflect the emotional peaks and troughs throughout; suddenly becoming warmer in moments of romance and fading to black in times of hardship. Its lack of subtlety felt out of place amongst the backdrop of wider literary extravagance and sumptuousness elsewhere. However, a saving grace was offered in the final scene &ndash; in which the brickwork upstage was illuminated from behind to reveal a series of small incisions in the fabric, causing a myriad of stars to shine through onto the embracing pair - a production full of potential that regrettably fails to propel itself away from the pitfalls of theatrical clich&eacute;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">Run ended.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2018-11-05 00:50:41', '2018-11-05 00:50:57', 'nye-jennie-review', 3, NULL, 1),

So maybe [I&rsquo;d be] still doing that, [it] depends on how well it went.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lou: </strong>It&rsquo;s been very natural. It&rsquo;s just kind of fallen into place. I don&rsquo;t think we ever expected to be touring the UK and gigging like that. It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rob: </strong>I don&rsquo;t think either of us ever expected to be able to tour Europe with a band. That was never in my head at the start.

We didn&rsquo;t really initially expect very much from it because, obviously we&rsquo;d never been there. And we were sort of wandering around the town before, walked back and there was just this massive queue and I was like, what&rsquo;s going on? It was just really good, really good vibes in the room.

I had no clue about that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jake: </strong>How did you hear about that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lou: </strong>Er, I spoke to numerous people about it.

You can&rsquo;t get away from it. And it is a very unique sound and it kind of just naturally influences you when you&rsquo;re writing, I guess. But I think we kind of consciously made the decision to try and steer clear of [that sound].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rob: </strong>I think as we&rsquo;ve gone forward though, like actually nowadays, it sort of changes doesn&rsquo;t it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lou:</strong> Yeah we&rsquo;ve got stone roses influences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rob: </strong>The Smiths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lou: </strong>We always listen to [them] because they&rsquo;re so hooky and chorus-y.

After a brief spoken introduction, it is straight back to the music, and one of Fender&rsquo;s most recent hits &lsquo;Dead Boys&rsquo; (recently named Annie Mac&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hottest Record in the World&rsquo;) comes early on in the set. Instantly recognisable to the crowd, this track gets one of the biggest reactions of the night, and there is certainly a sense of the magnitude of the issues that the record deals with in his performance, which is again deeply impassioned. It is no wonder that this track has become somewhat of an anthem for the issues that many young men face today, and it is truly one of the high points of the evening. Other highlights include Fender&rsquo;s latest single &lsquo;That Sound&rsquo;, with an unconventional but superb acapella start, and &lsquo;Greasy Spoon&rsquo;, where Fender&rsquo;s connection to each and every audience member is especially felt. Many of the other songs sung over the course of the evening are relatively unknown to the crowd, but if these are taken from Fender&rsquo;s upcoming album then we are certainly in for a treat.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><br />\r\nFender only properly chats with the audience on a few occasions, instead choosing to play many of his tracks back to back. Whilst this is fantastic for the momentum of his set, many might argue that the audience could benefit from more inter-song dialogue, particularly because when he does speak, his Geordie-charm makes him genuinely funny and endearing. One moment that stands out is when, during an intimate acoustic song towards the end of the evening, the lights flicker out for a few seconds, or when Fender speaks about his track &lsquo;Play God&rsquo;, telling us that &ldquo;one of the best days of my life was when this song got on FIFA&hellip;&rdquo; Whilst Fender is reserved in his dialogue, his attitude to music is the opposite, and it is at the end of the set, when the band leaves the stage and he is left with the piano, that we truly feel the raw power and beauty of his voice. The choice to play &lsquo;Leave Fast&rsquo; as his finale is perhaps Fender&rsquo;s most clever of the evening, leaving the audience chilled into a stunned silence at the sheer beauty of his stripped-back vocal prowess, and in no doubt that he is certainly one to watch.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 209, 1, '2018-11-05 17:16:25', '2018-11-05 17:16:25', 'sam-fender-at-the-mash-house', 1, 280, 0),

This atmosphere is immediately created as the Massachusetts-based ensemble collects their instruments and begins to sing. From the very first song of the gig, Auyon, David, Harris, and Don, crowd themselves around a single standing microphone to perform their tightly bound four-part harmonies. This creative decision not only succeeds in blending the group&rsquo;s voices so effortlessly, but also creates a uniquely intimate performance. The four are intensely united with one another on stage, which translates into the sense of intimacy shared with their audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If for nothing else, it is worth going to see Darlingside for their impeccable musicianship. Each band member changes instrument multiple times throughout the set, most swapping between three during the performance, whilst singing in some capacity on every song. Just when this mastery over multiple instruments becomes normalised, Auyon Mukharji, places his rather large mandolin onto his shoulder, picks up his bow, and proceeds to play the instrument as a violin. Providing no comment for this somewhat strange technique, for the next song he is again strumming it as normal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout, there is an enjoyable contrast between slow and fast songs. Just when the band is in danger of sounding too &lsquo;same-y&rsquo; with their extensive repertoire of slow, lyrical ballads, they play an upbeat, energetic song, which awakens the audience and gets the crowd moving. Although their performance is entirely simplistic, with little in the way of production, the foursome manage to create a lively and vibrant atmosphere. At points, Auyon plays his instrument in a way one can only describe as &lsquo;shredding the violin&rsquo;. If it weren&rsquo;t for their perfectly tuned folky harmonies, one could mistake the stage for some hard-core rock concert, if hard-core rock concerts included delicate violins and folky harmonies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/155/content_Darlingside-700x467.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 334px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crowd is excitable and loud, frequently shouting and whooping during some of the band&rsquo;s more up-tempo tunes. Not inclined to remain quiet themselves, there is a fair amount of conversation between the band and the audience. The group tells us about their experience in Scotland, tonight having been their fourth time in Scotland, but their first in Edinburgh. They each take it in turns to tell us something they have learnt during their day in the city, resulting in some crude banter, which is thoroughly appreciated by the, by now, rowdy crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The band proceed to tell us that they are now going to play an &lsquo;end of the earth&rsquo; section, giving us some political context to the songs that follow. There is a clear frustration in the lyrics, a frustration born out of the current political climate of their home country, the USA. For their last few songs, the four band members bring on support act, Hannah Reid, to join them. She plays the violin in accompaniment and is very well received by both the band themselves and the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is easy to judge a band on the atmosphere they are able to create and Darlingside clearly demonstrate their skills as beautiful storytellers, capable of creating both a calming and dynamic atmosphere. At the end of their set, the many shouts for an encore are proof enough of the audience&rsquo;s appreciation, and they will be thoroughly welcomed back to Edinburgh when their next UK tour approaches.</p>\r\n', 210, 1, '2018-11-06 22:56:51', '2018-11-06 23:00:44', 'darlingside-at-mash-house-edinburgh', 1, NULL, 0),

As Eyjafjallaj&ouml;kull begins to emit volcanic tremors and dislodge the icecap, the formidable duo become trapped in Delavois&rsquo; personal trailer, and it seems that set runner Leela will have more on her hands than her job description had entailed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a script written by comedic old-timers Adrian Edmondson and Nigel Planer, the premise certainly holds an assumed reputation that precedes it. As the show progressed, however, it became apparent that this potential is to remain unfulfilled. In the programme, Edmondson recalls that he and Planer had been looking to work together for a while, and that this production was borne through the rejection of yet another project that wasn&rsquo;t &lsquo;quite right&rsquo;. It is regrettable, then, that what is &lsquo;quite right&rsquo; falls on the wrong side of contemporary politics &ndash; choosing to mock the #MeToo movement and the radical idea that women in the film industry may exist as more than the sexualized objects of their male counterparts, not to mention the supposedly easy laugh in calling your rival &lsquo;gay&rsquo;. Though I&rsquo;m sure the humour was intended to land in a post-ironic sense &ndash; to mock the fact that we are even having this conversation in the 21st century &ndash; it came across in poor taste and aided to undermine the integrity of the production.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lois Chimimba has the difficult task of portraying Leela: a character who is charged with maintaining harmony and an actor who must single-handedly hold the entire production together. Her excellent characterization afforded Edmondson and Planer the wiggle room to wallow in the self-indulgence of their superfluous narrative; providing a large majority of plot points and humorous moments if indeed there were any.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her performance is well-complemented by Simon Higlett&rsquo;s charming set design, which takes the form of Delavois&rsquo; personal trailer on the film set. Mounted on some form of invisible, hydraulic piston system, it becomes increasingly tilted with every volcanic tremor and is dislodged to a frighteningly sharp angle &ndash; providing a most entertaining curtain call and I&rsquo;m sure an unenviable number of risk assessments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An unsatisfying production, <em>Vulcan 7</em> is obnoxious in its comedic preference and undermined by a dry and inconsequential script: though the film may be futuristic, its stagecraft remains very much rooted in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">Vulcan 7&nbsp;</span></em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">runs at the King&#39;s Theatre until Saturday 10th November 2018.</span></p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2018-11-09 22:55:34', '2018-11-09 22:55:34', 'vulcan-7-review', 3, NULL, 1),

', '<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/160/content_IMG_4414.JPG\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a gloomy and classically Scottish Friday evening, Gypsyfingers takes the stage at Edinburgh&#39;s Voodoo Rooms. Gypsyfingers, founded by Victoria and Luke Oldfield, describe themselves as an alternative folk, rock and pop duo. In the intimately small room, the four piece band set up as audience members trickle in. Before even beginning to perform, lead singer Victoria stands out wearing head to toe sequins, contrasting with the rest of her band who are casually dressed in t-shirts and jeans. As the set begins, Victoria and her husband Luke wear oversized hare and hound masks creating a striking, unique and mystical image; making them look as if they&#39;ve walked straight out of Narnia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Playing songs from their new album &#39;<em>Stranger Things</em>&#39;, Victoria&#39;s beautiful vocals instantly charm the room. Victoria is clearly a highly talented musician, impressing the audience by switching between singing and playing the keyboard, guitar and French horn. There is a focus on instrumental solos throughout the gig which showcases the talent of all four members of the band. Whilst Luke predominately plays guitar and harmonises with Victoria, he engages the crowds full attention as he sings two songs from the new album in which he solos; &#39;<em>Bruised</em>&#39; and &#39;<em>Blue Sky</em>&#39;. Victoria and Luke&#39;s voices compliment each other gorgeously in harmony yet they would benefit from not being drowned out so much by the slightly overpowering drumming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the gig is within its first twenty minutes or so, Victoria and Luke say nothing between their songs creating a distant and slightly moody atmosphere. Yet, as time progresses, they begin to give the audience little anecdotes. As they introduce &#39;<em>The Waves</em>&#39; they tell the crowd how this is their third gig in Edinburgh, Luke reminisces on the &#39;fond, hazy memories&#39; he has of going to university in the city. The drunken cheers from the neighbouring rooms 21st birthday party is a little distracting, yet Luke laughs it off and the band continue to capture the attention of their audience. Victoria elaborates on the concept of their new album, explaining that it&#39;s all about how &#39;&#39;life can be a bit weird&#39;&#39;. She also expresses how proud she is of the albums cover art which links to their hare and hound &#39;&#39;alter-ego&#39;&#39; imagery, demonstrated with the masks at the start of the gig. The height of audience interaction is with &#39;<em>Hey Maria</em>&#39;, Victoria discloses that Maria is indeed a real friend whom she met at 3am in a taxi, she gets the audience to participate and clap in time which makes everyone smile and sway along.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gig is overall very intimate, the musicians despite their otherworldly masks and quirky lyrics are evidently very down to earth, explaining how they mail out all their CD&#39;s and LP&#39;s themselves. As the show comes to a close, after multiple encores, Gypsyfingers greet the audience members individually before continuing on their UK tour.&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 278, 1, '2018-11-12 22:25:02', '2018-11-12 22:41:55', 'gypsyfingers-voodoo-rooms', 1, NULL, 0),

Celebrating the King&rsquo;s visit to Scotland and the first time that Scotland&rsquo;s national dress was worn by the public it was possibly one of the first times Scotland was branded and displayed an identity. Fast forward to 2018 and we have The Alternative Peers Ball hosted by legendary BBC Radio Scotland presenter Vic Galloway. The modern spin on an old event is a showcase of Scottish musical and artistic talent. Having debuted last year with headliners Django Django this year saw Kilmarnock&rsquo;s own Fatherson take the headline slot. Located in two rooms at the incredible Assembly Rooms on George Street the event included hip-hop, pop, alternative and rock music alongside live art from Too Much Fun Club as well as art from the talented Ursula Cheng. The main room also featured incredible lighting design from Projector Club. These incredible visuals added to the exceptional music throughout the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nFirst to hit the stage was Zoe Graham a Glasgow born singer songwriter. Tasked with tackling a big stage without her band she set the night off to a flying start. Using her guitar, keyboard and a looper pedal she created beautifully layered songs that captivated the growing audience. Consisting of songs from her debut EP released earlier this year she displayed her poignant lyricism that is well beyond her years. Zoe returns to Edinburgh on the 17th of November for a slot at Bongo Club. If you like stunningly layered instrumentals and flawless vocals then head along. You won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe first act to hit the second stage was Best Girl Athlete; recently shortlisted for the SAY Award with her self-titled album. Having listened to the record and enjoyed it I was disappointed by her live performance. With little stage presence she attempted to engage the audience with some lack lustre participation. Her single In Your Head did however lift spirits and she was met with applause. Perhaps after such recent acclaim I had expected more from the Aberdeen born singer who I felt gave a quite average performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAnother SAY Award shortlisted as well as SAMA nominated act hit the mainstage in the form of Kobi Onyame. Representing Scottish hip hop both within the context of the event but also internationally he has grown hugely in reputation with his latest album release &lsquo;Gold&rsquo;. Born in Ghana, raised in Norwich and London and based in Glasgow Kobi combines influences from Fela Kuti to American boom bap sound to create music that contains incredible beats, catchy hooks with considered and emotional lyricism. Kobi&rsquo;s performance was one that elevated the atmosphere to party mode. Songs such as Wedadi and Democrazy had the crowd dancing and singing along. With plans to tour the UK extensively next year be sure to catch a live show that guarantees fun, emotion and dancing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHaving released their incredible third album &lsquo;Could it be different?&rsquo; earlier this year The Spook School have gone from strength to strength. With two SXSW performances and a KEXP live session under their belt they brought their famous energy to a classy room with not only one but two chandeliers. Their post punk sound that deals with topics such as sexuality and identity is as infectious and the incredible that is their drummer Niall&rsquo;s performance. Once again a SAY Award shortlisted act the band have established themselves as one of Scotland&rsquo;s best exports. Memorable moments include their shameless promotion of Linda McCartney&rsquo;s vegetarian sausages and an unfortunately unsuccessful attempt to get the guys from Projector Club to use the sleep visual of a DVD player as part of their work stating that they want the floating DVD symbol to knock against the walls of the room. A treat for the ears, eyes and funny bone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHeadlining the second stage were the up and coming group Bossy Love. Featured by BBC Introducing they have been busy with recent releases such Whiplash and No Control. Front woman Amandah is undeniably a force to be reckoned with, with her incredibly energetic stage presence and enchanting voice. The electronic beats provided John and others provided a perfect high energy end to the night for Assembly rooms second stage. Destined for big thing expect to be hearing Bossy Love on all major radio stations soon. You heard it here first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The penultimate band to grace the main stage were rock band The Xcerts. Having played across the UK and Europe the band are clean rock favourites. I, however, found their performance to be cringe worthy. Punctuated by clich&eacute; moments the performance was once again a let-down considering my expectations. Undoubtedly, the band have established a sound and a fan base but I feel they lack any form of innovation and originality. Their performance seems to portray an ego beyond their ability which is disappointing to see. I expect to continue moderately enjoying their studio releases while disliking their stage presence and atmosphere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nFinishing the night off were headliners, Fatherson. Fresh from their sell out show of the Barrowlands the previous night, Alt Peers Ball was the end of their current tour stint. Having released their third album in September the band will be touring extensively in the New Year and most likely continue throughout next summer&rsquo;s festival season. A band that has gone from strength to strength since their debut album &lsquo;I am an Island&rsquo; in 2014 their performance has grown equally in scale. Lead singer, Ross Leighton provides unfaltering vocals while extreme levels of energy are supplied by bassist Marc Strain and drummer Greg Walkinshaw. Their latest album &lsquo;Sum of all your Parts&rsquo; has been featured heavily on mainstream radio culminating in a Maida Vale live session with Annie Mac earlier this week. Fatherson are on a trajectory towards massive success and I always expect bigger and better things. A perfect end to an incredible event which I hope returns in years to come. Although not sold out this event is an incredible showcase of home grown talent in an amazing venue. I would recommend anyone interested in good music attends. It not only provides something for everyone but a relaxed atmosphere in incredible surroundings.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 94, 1, '2018-11-13 12:01:59', '2018-11-13 12:06:30', 'alt-peers-ball-assembly-room-edinburgh', 1, 30, 0),

Interlaced with nuanced references to Shakespeare&rsquo;s work, it remains accessible to all &ndash; a true achievement in itself. Following Shakespeare as an individual - being the protagonist in his own story - is an interesting and seldom-used angle that personified the myth behind the pages and placed him in a relatable light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the heart of the story lies Will Shakespeare, a hopeless romantic whose writer&rsquo;s block does not serve well in the number of plays he has been commissioned to write. At a casting call for his latest (and very much incomplete) &lsquo;Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate&rsquo;s Daughter&rsquo;, he is presented with Thomas Kent &ndash; the male alter ego of Viola de Lesseps, whose dreams of performing on the stage cannot be achieved under the law that prevents all women from doing so. In a wonderfully-intricate and pseudo-Shakespearian turn of events, the duo become enamoured with each other and have to fight for their love in a complicated maze involving nobility, disguise and a distinctly regal dose of wordplay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pierro Niel-Mee&rsquo;s Shakespeare brings a sincerity that stands well with the determination of Imogen Daine&rsquo;s Viola; and the central pair are supported by a particularly well-cast company. Rowan Polonski provides expert comedic timing in his portrayal of the supercilious Ned Alleyn &ndash; actor extraordinaire and general high-achiever of Shakespeare&rsquo;s previous productions. It is a testament to Phillip Breen&rsquo;s holistic direction that every member of the large ensemble is able to come into their own, with each holding standout moments in their respective areas; delicately balancing the production both emotionally and spatially. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The set &ndash; a large, raised timer walkway mounted onto a revolving stage &ndash; is an ingenious solution of Max Jones to the wide array of locations within the play. Effortlessly transforming Viola&rsquo;s bedroom into a theatre stage with one slick rotation, it provides an interesting backdrop for Tina Machugh&rsquo;s atmospheric and creative lighting design. In particular, the use of candlesticks bathed the stage in a flickering glow, and the well-choreographed extinguishing of their flames serve to highlight the tragedies of a love that could never be &ndash; the outermost fragment of a truly wonderful production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\"><em>Shakespeare in Love&nbsp;</em>runs at the King&#39;s Theatre until Saturday 17th November 2018.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2018-11-14 14:45:32', '2018-11-14 14:45:32', 'shakespeare-in-love-review', 3, NULL, 1),

Would you say that image and the visual element of things are very important?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>CALLUM:</i> <i>I think its important, and we do spend a lot of time making sure that it comes across in a way that we would find cool if we were fans.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the live shows, was that always something that was important to you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>CALLUM: Well, when we started out, Euan didn&rsquo;t wanna play live at all, he hates live shows.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>EUAN: I never go to live shows.

Obviously the stages we play don&rsquo;t really lend themselves to that right now but I would love to get to a point where we could do those types of things.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that&rsquo;s your eventual goal?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>CALLUM: Well it would be amazing to do something like that, and still have it really inclusive for people, and have them be a part of it.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you think its tricky to strike that balance?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>CALLUM: I think it really is. At this level its much easier because youre so much closer to the audience, and you feel like youre sharing the whole thing together, rather than just putting on a show for the people in front of you.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>EUAN: That Coldplay wristbands thing does it pretty well, I think.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So you&rsquo;ve just done festival season this summer.

Stevie Wonder has donned his finest jacket and Teena Marie has put her feelings behind her in order to honour the man who created it all: Berry Gordy. At first reluctant to attend, the production opens at his home, and in a flashback that takes him back to his childhood the 1938 Joe Louis vs Max Schmeling boxing match, the tale of Motown begins to unfold in a glamorous chronology that commemorates both its highlights and ultimate demise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based upon Berry Gordy&rsquo;s personal memoirs, the production offers an undoubtedly biased but nonetheless enjoyable version of events. Relying predominantly on its exceptional cast and Motown soundtrack rather than its narrative, <em>Motown the Musical</em> offers a celebratory glimpse into an iconic era rather than an emotional exploration of its agents.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Karis Anderson is exceptional as Diana Ross, taking command of the stage with a punchy and mesmerizing elegance, with a vocal repertoire to match. She is a natural performer and confidently breaks the fourth wall in her interactive rendition of &lsquo;Reach Out and Touch&rsquo; without ruining the flow of the production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whilst evidently complex and technically well-executed, the colourful sliders that work to aide scene changes are jarring against wider scenic design choices &ndash; specifically, Daniel Brodie&rsquo;s modern projection design feels out of place in a musical about the late 20th century. Its caricature depictions of locations such as the Bahamas and the Copacabana Club seem incongruous as backdrops for the live action and true-to-life stories before them, giving the production a distinctly cartoon feel in an era that is anything but.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, this pseudo-jukebox musical holds as much character as it does energy. With superb choreography by Patricia Wilcox and Warren Adams and an eye-watering number of costume changes to match, <em>Motown the Musical</em> really is the epitome of high-intensity entertainment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">Motown the Musical&nbsp;</span></em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">runs at the Edinburgh Playhouse until Saturday 8th December 2018.</span></p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2018-11-22 17:21:18', '2018-11-22 17:21:44', 'motown-the-musical-review', 3, NULL, 1),

He is rehearsing for a haunting reimagination of Calder&oacute;n&rsquo;s 17th century dramatic text. In a translucent state of affairs, the prince and his saviour appear from the play in blurry fragments within the director&rsquo;s mind. Through creative abstractions, he develops supernatural powers and is granted blistered glimpses of otherworldly imaginings on the rehearsal room&rsquo;s walls as he assumes control of his own universe: just as the prince of Calder&oacute;n&rsquo;s play takes command through unmediated violence in a parallel sphere of reality. As the piece ventures beyond the confines of the concrete space and away from the privilege of control, the director, too, struggles in tandem with the prince&rsquo;s fear that the world could evaporate at any moment in fickle conceptualization.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a complicated and mysterious premise, yet serves as an atmospheric context for bold creative decisions within its staging. Kim Brandstrup&rsquo;s understated choreography is as intelligent as it is unimposing; requiring little to no knowledge of the plot to be appreciated. Set to Lutoslawski&rsquo;s foredboding composition, dancers drift in and out of the rehearsal room as sinewy ghosts; translucent and ethereal against the shadowy confines of the mottled room. It tells a tale of conflict: an opposition of desires that could well manifest in a variety of interpretations regardless of literary background.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Design by the Quay Brothers takes the form of mottled projections on the rehearsal room&rsquo;s walls, providing flickering motifs of other life; dictated neither by reality nor temporality. It is a chilling addition that casts the piece in dreamlike, noir and spectral haze. A partially-disfigured mannequin hovers in a shadowed corner; blurring the audience&rsquo;s ability to distinguish human from figure; dream from reality. The mirrored floor echoes what penetrates of Jean Kalman&rsquo;s dappled lighting design; blurring the ambiguous number of students resting against the walls while their director drifts in and out of lucidness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, whilst the production excels through its indulgence of the mysterious, it straddles the line of confusion &ndash; oftentimes slipping into the realm of sheer bewilderment. On the one hand, one might assume that a niche understanding of the Spanish Baroque literary canon is the barrier to entry within this context; but Rambert&rsquo;s interpretation is so far removed from Calder&oacute;n&rsquo;s work that it may well be a frame of reference within schemes of wider inspiration. Though individual elements can be appreciated, it becomes a challenge to pair ideas together. An impressive method of storytelling; but perhaps one that relies too heavily on technique than on narrative.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">Run ended.</span></p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2018-11-25 16:08:17', '2018-11-25 16:08:17', 'rambert-life-is-a-dream-review', 3, NULL, 1),

The Musical ', '<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/168/content_nativity.jpg\" style=\"width: 1600px; height: 900px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year again: a saccharine army of mince pies are slowly infiltrating the supermarkets and St. Bernadette&rsquo;s primary school is preparing itself for another Nativity production. As a trained actor, teacher Mr. Maddens seems the obvious choice for director, but a vague and painful memory of receiving minus two stars for his last executive endeavour seems to be hampering his Christmas spirit. And that&rsquo;s not to mention the smug Mr. Shakespeare from the rival Oakmoor School, whose acclaimed adaptations regularly snag the prestige of the critic&rsquo;s choice. In an awkward and competitive encounter, Mr. Maddens allows his imagination to get the better of him and suggests a few white lies in opposition to Mr. Shakespeare&rsquo;s pretentiousness, but the loveable if not bigmouthed classroom assistant Mr. Poppy has heard him out of context... In a whirlwind of events, the council has been notified and press requests are flying in: it seems Hollywood are coming to St. Bernadette&rsquo;s, and they want to make a feature film.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Nativity! The Musical</em> is positively dripping with joy. Adapted from the smash hit film series by its creator, Debbie Isitt, the production manages both to encapsulate the essence of its inspiration and exceed it &ndash; standing proudly in isoltation as a benchmark to which all other festive creations should compare themselves. Utilising both the songs from the film and a new repertoire by Nicky Ager and Debbie Isitt, the show holds something for all the family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simon Lipkin has a high-stakes role as Mr. Poppy, holding a lot of the plot&rsquo;s progression on his shoulders. He does so with flair and charisma, remaining firmly on the side of the line that reads &lsquo;endearing&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;entertaining&rsquo; - something that isn&rsquo;t always easy to do when his personality stems largely from childlike qualities. Scott Garnham&rsquo;s exasperated Mr. Maddens bounces well off Mr. Poppy&rsquo;s energy and stands in opposition to the well-meaning but over-excitable headteacher Mrs. Bevan, brought to life so excellently by Jemma Churchill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where the production truly shines is through the children of St. Bernadette&rsquo;s and Oakmoor School: roles played by a militia&nbsp;of local primary school talent. Their confidence is remarkable, and the quality of their performances could rival many a grown-up. Cracker the Dog completes the theatrical recipe of unadulterated entertainment; and that&rsquo;s not to mention the costume he dons for his Nativity debut at the end of the second act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David Woodhead&rsquo;s design is truly outstanding; encapsulating the very lifeblood of Christmas in every detail down to the last stitch. Glitter oozes from every star in the set design, and the&nbsp;fantastic imagery St. Bernadette&rsquo;s teachers dressed as planets really is a sight to behold. A triumph in its execution, <em>Nativity! The Musical</em> is as joyous as it is pure. Bursting from the seams with Christmas cheer: if you hadn&rsquo;t planned on erecting the tree this weekend, you certainly will be afterwards.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">Nativity!

Worsening every day, Mr. and Mrs. Darling are at their wit&rsquo;s end. They still have three other children to be strong for, but thankfully their mature daughter Wendy has once again assumed the role of intermittent emotional aide. As tragedy strikes, Tommy&rsquo;s illness succeeds him and the family are struck by grief. But one night soon after a strange boy named Peter flies through the window and mentions a land where the Lost Boys live. Standing as the only reasonable hope for getting Tommy back, Wendy and her brothers soon agree; and with a little help from a strange fairy called Tink they fly up and away to a new land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ella Hickson&rsquo;s nuanced script reimagines J.M. Barrie&rsquo;s original work, placing Wendy very much at the heart of the action. Transforming her from the role of &lsquo;mother&rsquo; into a pirate-battling, patriarchy-smashing and all-round powerhouse is a sure reminder of her former marginalization and is as intelligent as it is entertaining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max Johns&rsquo; design stylishly integrates building paraphernalia with childhood belongings to create an industrial feel in his far-away worlds. Scaffolding and foam blocks become tree-houses and bubbling oceans, speckled in and amongst balloon rainbows and suspended bathtubs as a grown-up climbing frame. It provides great potential for interesting staging, and Eleanor Rhode&rsquo;s direction really optimises upon this in the larger swash-buckling battle scenes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, where the production excels it is also subject to a sense of incoherency in its creative decisions. Transitions can often be clunky: especially those between Wendy&rsquo;s bedroom and Neverland &ndash; which require a small army of stagehands to re-construct four beds in particularly long black-outs that serve to disrupt any sense of disbelief.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, Isobel McArthur brings a distinct air of authenticity to Wendy as she undergoes a transformation in herself: from the girl outlawed by make-believe due to her gender into the revolution-leading powerhouse of courage that she has never been able to express. Ziggy Heath&rsquo;s Peter Pan is charming and playful and brings a sense of poignancy to the darker elements of the play: particularly towards the end of the second act when he takes Wendy up into the stars. Sally Reid plays Tink with as much wit as consideration; as the uncaring (but secretly compassionate) fairy who has Peter&rsquo;s best wishes at heart to the detriment of anyone who may distract him &ndash; most notably Wendy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With some charming stagecraft and a whole load of fairy dust, <em>Wendy and Peter Pan</em> is an enchanting production fit for all the family. Carefully breaking the fourth wall to transport younger audiences away as it follows the second star on the right and straight on till morning, it&rsquo;s going back to the heroic battles of youth&hellip; it&rsquo;s going to Neverland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">Wendy and Peter Pan&nbsp;</span></em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">runs at the Lyceum Theatre until 5th Januray 2019.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2018-12-02 14:05:15', '2018-12-02 14:05:15', 'wendy-and-peter-pan-review', 3, NULL, 1),

(154, 'Interview with Tin Pigeons', 'Lizzie Lewis has the bants with Fraser and Tom from East Midlands band Tin Pigeons, discussing touring, their influences, and improvising songs about yoghurt. ', '<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><!-- x-textbox/html --></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/172/content_tin_pig.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 400px;\" />Tin Pigeons are meant to finish their soundcheck at Henry&rsquo;s Cellar Bar and be interviewed at 6.30pm, but don&rsquo;t manage this until an hour later. They are very apologetic as I follow them into their van for the interview, where they make me laugh so much that I fully forgive them for their poor time-keeping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing I learn about Tin Pigeons is that they have just found a mini table football set someone had abandoned on the pavement, and that they are very excited about this. As Fraser puts it: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bloody steal.&rdquo; The second thing I learn about them is that they love Scotland, and love Scottish accents. Tom briefly (and rather unsuccessfully) attempts one, before apologising for any offence caused to my people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tin Pigeons are from the countryside, in the East Midlands near Leicester. &ldquo;You literally couldn&rsquo;t get any more central.&rdquo; Morris dancing is big there apparently, but there is not much of a music scene. So they began to play music because they &ldquo;weren&rsquo;t good at sport and there wasn&rsquo;t much else to do.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The band don&rsquo;t tend to write on tour, they wish they did, but because of the amount of travel, they just tend to watch films on the bus instead. Like John Hughes&rsquo; 1989 classic <em>Uncle Buck</em>. (We have a brief discussion about John Candy&rsquo;s premature death. Say what you like about Tin Pigeons, but those boys love a tangent).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One aspect of touring that they like however, is visiting new places. They visited North Berwick the day before our interview, and loved Bass Rock. &ldquo;So beautiful, and we never would&rsquo;ve gone there, if we hadn&rsquo;t come on tour. Touring is a bit of a holiday like that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When one usually imagines a band on tour, excessive consumption of drugs and/or alcohol might be something that springs to mind. But Tom confesses their only excess is the amount of Chinese food the band has been eating on this tour. &ldquo;Had one last night, had one this morning.&rdquo; All-you-can-eat buffets are quite good on a budget, and the boys are adamant that a clear strategy is vital when going in, claiming they have refined maximum buffet consumption in minimal time to a precise art. &ldquo;You have to be serious. No carbs. We had three platefuls each in 15 minutes last night at China Red.&rdquo; says Fraser. &ldquo;Fraser had a pudding as well, he put jelly on a prawn cracker. We got some weird looks&rdquo; claims Tom. &ldquo;The staff were chasing us out the door with a broom.&rdquo; Then Fraser gets a text from TP guitarist Duncan, who is apparently back at China Red for round three as we speak. Fraser speculates that Duncan may shortly have a heart attack. &ldquo;I feel a bit sick just thinking about that.&rdquo; Tom admits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back to writing. The band are unsigned, so the business side of things takes up a lot of their time. They feel a bit guilty sometimes because of this, but that&rsquo;s why they love it when they do get to write. Fraser handles all the lyrics - &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always had a way with words, he&rsquo;s very charming&rdquo; &ndash; whereas Tom does the composition. Whilst they don&rsquo;t write on the road, the two admit to randomly composing little songs about various objects. Fraser says this is down to spending so much time together that they just develop and share odd idiosyncrasies. There is a brief pause where Tom (who worries he shouldn&rsquo;t be showing me this) gets up a video of their drummer Rory singing a ditty about Petit Filou yoghurt. Its very silly. &ldquo;So we do actually write on the road, some absolute bangers mate.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I ask what they think makes a good live show. &ldquo;Energy, definitely. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter what we sound like, as long as we look like we&rsquo;re having fun&rdquo; says Tom. &ldquo;Its just so much fun. We could be playing to literally nobody, which we have done, and its still the best thing in the world&rdquo; Fraser continues. &ldquo;Like in Newcastle, there were maybe only 30 people there, but because everyone was absolutely loving it, it was such a great gig. Even if tonight isn&rsquo;t crazy busy, if people have given up their evening to buy a ticket to our show, that is f***ing insane! That&rsquo;s so cool, and whatever level that is, even if its just one person, its worth doing.&rdquo; They love meeting fans as well. &ldquo;To be able to speak to someone during tour who isn&rsquo;t Fraser is honestly such a relief&rdquo; says Tom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tin Pigeons are often classed as an indie folk band. I wonder what the boys think of this. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that, yeah. Folk in the sense of the raw element to our songs, we&rsquo;re quite acoustic-y. And also folk in its purest sense is all about storytelling, and our songs always have stories behind them, either about us or people we know&rdquo; says Fraser. &ldquo;Or petit filou&rdquo; interjects Tom. &ldquo;The bounce is the indie, and the guitar-yness is the folk.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their influences are quite folksy. Bob Dylan and Ben Howard are mentioned, and then we discuss Mumford and Sons. Fraser loves their debut album &ndash; &ldquo;crankingly good&rdquo; &ndash; but denounces their new music as too safe. &ldquo;<em>Wilder Mind </em>(the third Mumford record) was so good, because they completely broke the mould, from everything everyone thought they were, like foot-stomping banjo solos, and went instead towards a blend of different styles. This new album just feels really safe, just nice pretty songs with simple choruses. Its good, its just got nothing on the last one.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I ask what artists they think are pushing boundaries. &ldquo;Ben Howard&rdquo; says Fraser. &ldquo;I honestly think he&rsquo;s gonna be this generation&rsquo;s Bowie. His records have all been experimental, and I think he&rsquo;s gonna keep pushing boundaries and playing with soundscapes.&rdquo; &ldquo;I think its really important to push boundaries, otherwise you just go stale&rdquo; says Tom. &ldquo;As long as it comes from you, from the heart, then its always gonna be original&rdquo; says Fraser. &ldquo;Our latest single, that&rsquo;s a similar vibe to our older stuff, but also we&rsquo;ve tried to play around with the production a lot, and go somewhere new with it.&rdquo; Says Tom.&nbsp; &ldquo;If all we ever wrote were the same bouncy summery pop songs, I think we&rsquo;d get bored. We write music for ourselves.&rdquo; Says Fraser. I wonder if this is why they remain independent, to keep complete control. &ldquo;Yeah. There&rsquo;s a stigma at the moment that to be a successful band, you have to be signed, and have a whole team in place, and that&rsquo;s bullshit. You don&rsquo;t need it. It is the hardest graft, but it means we get to sit in a van talking to you in Edinburgh, which is so cool, and really humbling, and there might only be ten people there tonight, but who gives a shit, because we love it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After our interview, Tin Pigeons shake my hand and dart off to China Red, presumably to fill up on as much chow mein and ice cream as possible, before absolutely smashing their gig that night at Henry&rsquo;s. To attend a Tin Pigeons gig is to witness first-hand not just a brilliant live band, but four individuals who obviously have a genuine love for their songs, and get a life-affirming thrill out of playing them. An inspiring band, and one to definitely keep an eye out for. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tin Pigeons&rsquo; new single &lsquo;You&rsquo;re No Fun&rsquo; is out now (and it&rsquo;s a class A banger).</p>\r\n', 214, 1, '2018-12-04 11:26:34', '2018-12-04 11:26:34', 'interview-with-tin-pigeons', 1, NULL, 0),

The pair realise that producing a flop could &nbsp;- if all goes to plan - generate more money than a success. With the help of the worst director they could find - Roger DeBris - and his acid-tongued assistant Carmen Ghia, the producers set about staging &lsquo;Springtime for Hitler&rsquo; on Broadway, feeling secure in the knowledge that it will be a disastrous failure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max McLaughlin&rsquo;s Bialystock opens the show with a strong, unfaltering performance that carries on throughout. Featuring in and nailing many crucial songs, his talent as a performer is clear. He is perfectly matched by Rob Merriam&rsquo;s Bloom, a believable comedy wonder whose character brings a laugh a minute and creates a dynamic duo from the get go. Leading lady Georgie Rogers&rsquo; vocals soar, captivating the audience as the sought-after-love-interest-slash-swedish-secretary, Ulla. Taliah Horner plays Roger DeBris with flair, injecting showbiz sparkle into the heart of the play.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a lot to be said for the talent within the ensemble too. Under Kirsten Millar&rsquo;s clever direction and complemented by fun choreography from Kathryn Young, the ensemble really make the musical what it is. Featuring many over-the-top comedic and camp caricatures, tap dancing walking frames and some powerful vocals, the story is skyrocketed to its full potential. The drama that unfolds is further amplified by the accomplished 17-piece pit band, expertly led by musical director Caitlin Morgan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The set and tech aspects were striking, brilliantly matching the big city atmosphere; especially the silhouetted skyline of New York against the colour changing backdrop, heightening the different moods in every scene. The attention to detail within the production was excellent, with every prop thought out and every change of costume of high-quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is clear that a huge effort has gone in from production team and performers and it has most certainly paid off, creating a magnificent piece of student theatre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">Run ended.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2018-12-04 15:40:25', '2018-12-04 15:43:01', 'the-producers-review', 3, NULL, 0),

The&nbsp;amount of energy the band have could have filled a much larger stage than that of Sneaky Pete&#39;s,&nbsp;however the grungy vibe of the venue suited them perfectly.&nbsp;Allen is highly interactive with his audience and clearly very keen to make sure the audience have&nbsp;as much energy and enthusiasm as he has. He introduces each song by its name and tells little&nbsp;anecdotes about Bolton nightlife and how their UK tour has gone so far. It is clear as the band&nbsp;continues that they all have a great appreciation for each others musical talents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Allen brings a slightly more serious and heartwarming tone to the gig as he introduces the song&nbsp;&#39;110 ways to make things better&#39; which he reveals is about his father passing away due to a brain&nbsp;tumour. Yet this song certainly does not bring the mood down, the atmosphere is very uplifting. As&nbsp;the band begin to play &#39;White Lines&#39; a tambourine is whipped out and they draw the audience even&nbsp;closer in. Allen jumps off the stage and comes into the audience for his guitar solo which drives the&nbsp;energy levels up even higher. The band introduce their new release &#39;Naked&#39;, encouraging the&nbsp;audience to put it on their Spotify playlists as they want to have more of a Scottish following. Their&nbsp;goal is to fully sell out their gig the next time they return to Scotland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The band round off the gig with their hit song &#39;Rosie&#39; which has the entire audience dancing and&nbsp;clapping in time. They come to a dramatic end with strobe lighting as they give the microphone and&nbsp;tambourine to the audience. Playfully inviting the audience to join them in Newcastle the follows&nbsp;day, they come off the stage and greet the audience and their friends who had been supportively&nbsp;singing along to the side throughout the gig. We hope to see Jordan Allen at an even larger and&nbsp;sold out venue the next time they return to Edinburgh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by Izzy Parriss</p>\r\n', 143, 1, '2018-12-10 18:56:47', '2018-12-10 18:57:41', 'jordan-allen-at-sneaky-pete-s', 1, NULL, 0),

There is gin in her hand and she has come to her wit&rsquo;s end. As her worries begin to engulf her, she takes another step towards the rocky edge - but at the last second a young boy pulls her backwards and away from the dangers of gravity. Highlighting the bleak truths of poverty in Edinburgh, <em>Mouthpiece</em> confronts its audience with questions that leave a sour taste long after the final bow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So begins the unlikely relationship between Libby and Declan &ndash; two members of the same city, whose common ground seems only to extent to the similarity of their home turf. Declan likes to draw, but would never consider himself an artist. Artists are people who can afford to float around and order pretentious coffees and go for brunch. His doodles are just a hobby; and in his stepfather&rsquo;s eyes a hobby that takes time away from paid employment. Libby, on the other hand, is a writer. But what does that actually mean? And can she still use the title of writer considering the long absence since her last work?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kieran Hurley&rsquo;s masterful script effortlessly captures the essences of two supposedly opposing lives without resorting them to the caricatures of stereotype. In his nuanced exploration of how class and privilege intersect with the lived experience of a shared locality, Hurley asks to what extent the theatre is able to portray another person&rsquo;s story without talking for them &ndash; or worse yet, taking their story away from them. As Libby begins to construct a work that explores poverty in Edinburgh, she takes inspiration from Declan. At first a champion for the marginalised; her script begins to build traction and finances are negotiated. But Libby is making money from Declan&rsquo;s story while he continues to live it - at what point does inspiration become poverty porn?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neve McIntosh is outstanding as Libby &ndash; the well-meaning writer whose privilege clouds her ability to write through a reflexive lens and who finds both solace and employment in the young Declan &ndash; played endearingly by Lorn Macdonald &ndash; a boy whose creativity is limited by the circumstance into which he was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Orla O&rsquo;Loughlin&rsquo;s direction is at once powerful and modest &ndash; carefully differentiating between the narrative and meta moments in order to confront the audience. Specifically, scenes in which Libby breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience through the framework of traditional literary guidelines serve as a stark reminder in indicating the role writers play in telling stories of which they have no personal experience. Through so clearly indicating that <em>Mouthpiece</em> is a piece of theatre, its plot is transformed from entertainment into reality. What may seem like a night out for the ticketholder does not merely end for its protagonists once the curtain has come down.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A superb and harrowing diagnosis of society which examines the extent to which circumstance dictates both future and individual agency, <em>Mouthpiece</em> will work to inform, challenge and confront &ndash; a real must-see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">Mouthpiece&nbsp;</span></em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">runs at the Traverse Theatre until Saturday 22nd December 2018.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2018-12-22 00:58:59', '2018-12-24 01:16:06', 'mouthpiece-review', 3, NULL, 1),

Due to the nature of his work, McGonagall is often reduced to a historical caricature, but McNair explores his darker context: one of violent humiliation, class struggles and emotional hardship. He is joined on stage by musicians Simon Liddell and Brian James O&rsquo;Sullivan, who provide both atmospheric accompaniment and moments of humour through carefully interspersed cameo interjections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McNair&rsquo;s hour-long monologue takes a similar to format to McGonagall&rsquo;s literary style: one that often sacrifices coherency for the sake of rhyme &ndash; in whatever format that may be. It is a charming idea, but never manages to quite take flight. The narrative &ndash; as charming as it may be &ndash; is superficial in its content; deriving most of its humour through hanging rhymes and other literary shortfalls McGonagall uses in his work. It intersects uncomfortably through moments in McGonagall&rsquo;s career where he is physically assaulted on stage and undermined for the cheap laughs that he is forced to endure in funding his family&rsquo;s table.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, <em>McGonagall&rsquo;s Chronicles</em> takes a unique stance on an otherwise well-known story, and presents events in a more relatable light.

Following a conversation with his put-together friend, John, a Rhinoceros is spotted stampeding through their town causing the locals to react with a mixture of confusion, anger, awe and despair. What begins as an odd and amusing occurrence transforms into a much more sinister phenomenon as the townsfolk themselves begin changing into Rhinoceroses</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theatre Paradok&#39;s presentation of Eugene Ionesco&#39;s absurdist play updates the political messages of the original script and setting to the modern day, and it is largely successful in doing so. There are several standout performances; most especially Angus McHarg&#39;s portrayal of the central character. As the events of the narrative escalates, he finds his position as an outsider unchanged yet is totally terrified and disgusted by his own humanity at the play&#39;s climax. Other praiseworthy performances are given by James Strahan as Duddard -&nbsp;who adopts a constant state of calm and acceptance among the absurdity of the situation &nbsp;-and Camilla Makhmudi&#39;s Daisy who is&nbsp;the romantic focus of both Berenger and Duddard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cast works well as an ensemble, too, particularly during the first Rhinoceros sighting. Katrina Wooley&#39;s effective direction comes across here and in the scene changes. From street cafe, to bedroom and office to kitchen table each scene has a particular and realised mood from which the actors can build the tension of the script. The lighting and tech also contribute to this and so the audience is engaged from the outset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An interesting addition to Theatre Paradok&#39;s production is the use of audience interaction via Facebook Messenger. Audience members receive&nbsp;a barcode, and once scanned they were added to a group chat. This group was sent notifications at various points, mostly during scene transitions. It was fun to see audience members reacting in real time to what was happening on stage and while its hard to say exactly what it added, it certainly did not detract from the experience. All things considered the cast and crew of Rhinoceros created a show with some thoroughly enjoyable moments, strong acting across the board and a highly entertaining evening. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">Run ended.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2018-12-24 01:24:18', '2018-12-24 01:24:18', 'rhinoceros-review', 3, NULL, 1),

By logic, Charlie Price is now in charge, but he has just moved to London with his girlfriend in search of a cosmopolitan lifestyle and is hesitant to take the reins from his late father. His worries are exacerbated when a backlog of past orders pushes the factory to the brink of financial collapse, and Charlie is forced to seek an alternative. It seems his answer is found with the beautiful &ndash; if not broad-shouldered &ndash; Lola, a glamorous drag queen who, along with her equally-talented colleagues, serve as a niche market for male-sized, industrial-strength, sensual heels. Together, Charlie and Lola must put aside their differences in search of a shoe worthy of the infamous Milan catwalk &ndash; where not only fashion, but prejudices, are redefined.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kayi Ushe gives a show-stopping performance as Lola, serving both looks and heart-melting vocals. He gives life to Jerry Mitchell&rsquo;s fierce choreography; commanding the attention of both the factory floor and the audience with his troupe of multi-coloured, glittering Angels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is complemented well by Joel Harper-Jackson&rsquo;s equally-impressive Charlie &ndash; an individual whose desire to do please everybody too often clouds his sense of pragmatism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cyndi-Lauper&rsquo;s award-winning score is as punchy as it is endearing. Pairing ballads with crowd-raising dance numbers, she animates the plot in a way in which the well-known film &ndash; the starting point for the musical &ndash; cannot; both at once preserving its cinematic charm whilst simultaneously giving it a fresh sense of innovation. Charlie&rsquo;s love interest and factory worker Nicola &ndash; played by Charlie Allen &ndash; is able to shine in her humorous rendition of &lsquo;The History of Wrong Guys&rsquo;; a particularly memorable number through which the rebellious charm for which Lauper is known flourishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A feast for both the eyes and the soul, <em>Kinky Boots</em> will fill your heart with joy and your trousers with fishnets.

Memory being the theme to which this story of almost inescapable sadness is centred. It&rsquo;s also about loss, isolation, powerlessness, connection and the inevitable marching on of time toward the end of the world. The EUTC&rsquo;s production - directed by Lucy Davidson - does the script justice for the vast majority of its runtime.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe narrative runs through several settings of time and location in England and Australia between 1959 and 2039. These interweave throughout, and in several points the older and younger versions of certain characters perform together on stage in quite beautiful memory sequences -&nbsp;these are points where Davidson&rsquo;s direction really comes on strong. There is a projection at the back wall signifying which timeline is currently being watched and images showing the setting: a sunset over barren cliffs for the Coorong in South Australia, or rows of grey houses for London. It is effective and the story is conveyed through every aspect of the staging: from the lighting, to the costume and the pipeline installed in the rigging where real (and freezing) rain cascades on to the stage. The music and sound used at specific times also add to a melancholic immersion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe initial monologue where Gabriel York, played by Barney Rule, in 2039 tells the audience of his life of solitude, and calls the miraculous event &ndash; a fish falling from the sky &ndash; the best thing that&rsquo;s ever happened&nbsp;in his life, sets the tone for the bleakness which pervades the narrative. Barney Rule sets the performance bar very high and he delivers this first speech with a tender nervousness showing the affects of years of isolation. The syntax in this monologue is reprised throughout the play and each time the lines are heard again the audience gains new understanding of just how tragic the circumstances are. Praise should be given to the entire ensemble in terms of acting, although at times the Australian accents were slightly shaky. However, the scenes where the most important aspects of the plot are revealed, the most tragic elements take over and the connection between every character is highlighted, all the actors shine. These moments felt like being stabbed in the heart and I can&rsquo;t deny the tears that were in my eyes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOverall, the cast and crew created an excellent, memorable and stirring production. All involved should be very proud. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\"><em>Run ended.</em></span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2019-02-10 21:16:33', '2019-02-10 21:16:33', 'when-the-rain-stops-falling-review', 3, NULL, 1),

Unfortunately, <em>The Cat in the Hat</em> failed to achieve either. Following the tale of two siblings who are forced to play inside on a horrible and rainy day, Dr. Seuss&rsquo; tale is a joyous exploration of the innocent chaos that erupts with the visit of the Cat &ndash; a hat-wearing, mess-creating feline visitor &ndash; and his two accomplices in crime: the boisterous and uncontrollable Thing 1 and Thing 2.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isla Shaw&rsquo;s set design is instantly striking; taking the form of a large house interior, crafted in the iconic pseudo-illustrative aesthetic of Dr. Seuss&rsquo; books. It is a charismatic nod to the marvellous worlds of Seussville, but the harshness of its black and white tonality clash with the otherwise vibrant action of the plot.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sally and the Boy - played by Melissa Lowe and Sam Angell, respectively &ndash; are endearing, but are deflated by an ill-fitting original score. Though Tasha Taylor Johnson&rsquo;s songs come with their own merit, they land above the level of a younger audience; with few motifs carrying through to bind the production together.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nana Amoo-Gottfried has a difficult job in portraying the Cat &ndash; a role hard to separate from personal interpretation and Mike Myers&rsquo;s extravagant performance in the 2003 film &ndash; and manages to make the role his own. However, the slow-paced and erratic dialogue afford him no justice and his vocal style does not conform to that intended by the score.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The suspenseful arrival of Thing 1 and Thing 2 holds a great deal of potential, but is ultimately unsatisfying as a lacklustre representation of supposed anarchy. Acrobats Celia Francis and Robert Penny are evidently talented - with some of their gravity-defying stunts affording moments of grin-inducing disbelief &ndash; but the overdrawn routines in which they run around the stage with their hands in the air make for neither use nor ornament. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A production where everything works, but nothing quite fits.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">Run ended.</span></em><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2019-02-11 15:48:01', '2019-02-11 15:48:01', 'the-cat-in-the-hat-review', 3, NULL, 1),

With only minimal supplies and each other for support, things were looking up as they reached the summit. The descent, however, proved somewhat of a different story; with harsh weather forcing them into a turn of events that would see Joe slip: the impact of which forcing his knee into his lower shin and puncturing his upper thigh. As Richard assumes full responsibility for Joe, he is confronted with a life-or-death decision after Joe falls over an icy overhang &ndash; dangling above the abyss attached only to Simon. So begins the narrative of Simon&rsquo;s predicament: does he cut the rope holding his companion, or suffer the same &ndash; seemingly inevitable &ndash; fate himself? As pragmatism conquers over sentiment, Joe falls to what is likely to be his death. Except another strange incident means a ledge breaks his fall; and so begins his solo journey to try and get home.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ti Green&rsquo;s innovation shines through in her design; crafting an icy summit out of a metallic grid scaffold suspended from the rigging, sporadically pasted in shreds of white paper. It provides a curious platform for the actors to navigate; effortlessly tiptoeing across biting topographies high above the stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the rope has been cut, the story becomes largely individualistic &ndash; following the harrowing plight of Joe as he hauls his damaged body across unimaginable terrain. It is a truly gripping story, but one that doesn&rsquo;t instantly lend itself to the stage. In order to provide some variation, David Greig&rsquo;s adaptation inserts the hallucinogenic presence of Joe&rsquo;s sister, who &nbsp;adopts the role of mountain expert-cum-motivator. Chris Davey&rsquo;s lighting design begin to reflect the fragmentation of his psyche; becoming more colourful and erratic as the storyline progresses although never manages to sit consistently with the rest of the production. There is a distinct change of tone before and after the severance of the rope &ndash; but such a creative decision serves to alienate the second act from the consistency of the narrative, with the effect being an unfortunate lack of coherence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, Fiona Hampton is excellent as Joe&rsquo;s sister, Sarah.

It&rsquo;s one of the biggest grossing comedies of all time (totalling up to &pound;200 million world-wide) according to the show program;&nbsp;which is why I was so surprised at how disappointing I found this performance. Although the actors - Nigel Haver, Denis Lawson and Stephen Tompkinson - are all titans of the acting world and undeniably talented, the combination of the poor acoustics in the theatre and the outdated presentation of the play&nbsp;resulted in a stifled performance of little emotional investment on the audience&rsquo;s part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nReza&rsquo;s script is fascinating:&nbsp;most impressively, it shone a light on the generational divide. For most of the audience members it was laugh out loud funny. Instead, my peers and I found it thought-provoking, with moments of profound insight within an ultimately sad story. The direction of the play was designed to pull in laughs but it actually felt like Reza&rsquo;s true talent is in insightful, tragic and dynamic dialogue. For me, the play explores the transition into modernism and the changing world of the 1990s,&nbsp;when postmodernism exposed our constructed identities. Through this play, Reza shows us that our identities are based on our experience of others. &lsquo;I am because you are and you are because I am&rsquo; &ndash; or something like that. All three men embody an ideology and we watch as these ideologies come to blows.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNevertheless, the premise is interesting and I genuinely think that, fundamentally,&nbsp;the script is excellent. It just didn&rsquo;t feel exciting because it came across outdated by thirty years. The black out lighting transitions, the tinkly music and clunky lighting felt awkward. I just don&rsquo;t think three&nbsp;older white&nbsp;men talking about modern art and&nbsp;their feelings in a convoluted way is subversive or exciting. Art and theatre have moved on and this production could do with an update.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">ART&nbsp;</span></em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">runs at the King&#39;s Theatre until Saturday 16th February 2019.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2019-02-16 18:32:55', '2019-02-16 18:32:55', 'art-review', 3, NULL, 1),

One day, a surprise visitor - who finds his employment in helping people - comes along and plants a little seed of hope: the enchanted magic to be found in an old, broken button. As the seed grows, Ted discovers a newfound purpose: cleaning his house and adding a splash of colour to the interior decorations, so that his green-leafed company can grow happily. All seems lost, however when eventually the tree grows too large for the home, and Ted is forced to leave it outside. But that&rsquo;s the thing with a little gift: its size is not proportional to its wonders. Every day villagers come by to see Ted&rsquo;s magnificent tree, blossoming high above the terraces &ndash; and Ted&rsquo;s lonely existence is transformed into one of delight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The set &ndash; the delightfully eclectic and transformative creation of Joss Matzen, John Matzen and Sharon McWilliams &ndash; consists of a hillock of old and dusty suitcases; inside which exist the localities of Ted&rsquo;s journey: a towelled beach, a snowy mountain and a glittering party. There is a thrill to be had in the opening of each suitcase and the reveal of another scene, and the overall effect is both innovative and joyous. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guy Hargreaves as the surprise visitor is as skilful as he is endearing.

Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m not convinced this recent stage version, adapted by Antony Lampard and presented by The Classic Thriller Theatre Company, will be receiving any similar accolades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The premise is fairly simple: a young woman, Iris Henderson, travelling via train from Vienna back to London befriends an older lady, Miss Froy, who then mysteriously vanishes along the route. Setting out to find her kindly friend, the protagonist discovers that the other passengers deny ever seeing the older woman. Cue accusations of hallucination, Nazi intrigue and an obnoxious English &lsquo;prince charming&rsquo; who&rsquo;ll act as investigating assistant, love interest and all-round condescending nuisance. All the ingredients are there for a gripping WWII-era mystery. The problem with that is expectations fall into one of two categories: atmospheric Agatha Christie-esque twists and turns or jolly comedic espionage romp. However, The Mousetrap this is not. Nor is it The 39 Steps. It was neither as suspenseful as the former, nor as funny as the latter. Rather than a complementary mix of the two, it ended up a half-baked version of neither. Every development felt predictable, every reaction overwrought. The theatrical challenges in adapting a film, a medium which enjoys advantages in omniscience, editing and subtlety, were clearly on display.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Individual performances were generally good, but actors forced to project and exaggerate dulled the sense of mystery. Progressively, scenes verged on farce as characters were obliged to describe in detail every movement taking place beyond the imaginary train windows, ending in prolonged explanatory dialogue of the &lsquo;now this is happening, now this is happening&rsquo; nature. There were many moments of light-hearted, intentional humour sprinkled throughout the play, but I don&rsquo;t think this was meant to be one of them. The incessant description only served to highlight the lack of imagination on the part of the production team as well as the scriptwriter; theatrical tricks to convey events from afar, such as shadow puppets or projection, were lacking. The result was a strong cast choked by their torturous dialogue, not quite managing to disguise how forced the presentation of nervous energy in a crisis is when you&rsquo;re rooted to the spot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certainly, moments of greater fluidity stood out, injecting some much-needed dynamism into an oft-flat production. The panic created by Lorna Fitzgerald&rsquo;s Iris in the closing scene of the first act, for instance, provoked a crescendo of well-choreographed chaos. However, the promise offered to audience members as they attend to their pre-ordered interval drinks of a pacier second act is not fulfilled, and the plodding progress of predictability continues. The swift scene changes do provide the sense of movement you&rsquo;d expect from a vehicular setting, as do the lighting effects, dancing across the stage; however, such transitions fail to compensate adequately for the laborious dialogue.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indubitably, the stand-out performance was Juliet Mills as Miss Froy, who captured perfectly the gentle but crafty English governess, endearing us to her in the relatively short time she features on stage. Indeed, it was a pity she was the one who vanished. It would of course be difficult for the other actors to successfully distract from the gender stereotypes and clich&eacute;d British bullishness of a script adapted from a film that is &lsquo;of its time.&rsquo; Even so, for a twenty-first century audience it&rsquo;s hard not to suppress a sharp intake of breath every time the male lead Max &nbsp;- played by Matt Barber - makes his questionable comments to Iris, such as informing her of how lovely she looks when she smiles. Iris herself, talkative and persistent early in the investigation, fades away when the action proper unfolds, designated to the back of the carriage for the duration of the d&eacute;nouement or, as I have no doubt Max would have put it had he gotten the chance, &lsquo;the scary bit.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The actors cannot be blamed for the script however, and unless the adaptation were to be a complete re-imagination for our times, perhaps frown-inducing moments of patriarchal agony are to be expected. Visually, the set was convincing and practical, capturing the atmosphere of the period whilst enabling the brisk transitions between scenes. The sliding train doors which helped us peer into two sleepers at once were clever; it was just a pity nothing more innovative was designed to minimise the endless descriptions of what was occurring beyond the windows. Nonetheless, in the elegant setting of the Edwardian King&rsquo;s Theatre the play has found a complementary home in Edinburgh and for a theatrical night-out which is visually pleasing and demands little thinking, with some gentle laughs thrown in for good measure, it&rsquo;ll certainly do the trick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a train wreck but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d bother boarding again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\"><em>The Lady Vanishes&nbsp;</em>runs at the King&#39;s Theatre until Saturday 23rd February 2019.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2019-02-20 21:41:17', '2019-02-20 21:41:17', 'the-lady-vanishes-review', 3, NULL, 1),

After much debate over their name, a &#39;sign&#39;&nbsp;allowed the boys to settle with &lsquo;The Four Seasons&rsquo;. Told through the four perspectives of the band members, their differences are highlighted as each narrative comes with a season (Tommy - Spring, Bobby - Summer, Nick - Fall,&nbsp;and Frankie - Winter). This biographical musical maps their lives, both as individuals and as a quartet navigating the trials and pitfalls of the music industry - from their humble beginnings in The Silhouette Cafe, to the Rock&#39;n&#39;Roll hall of fame. The individual nuances of each character are brilliantly brought to life in a very naturalistic way by - Michael Watson (Frankie), Lewis Griffiths (Nick), Simon Bailey (Tommy) and Declan Egan (Bobby). From the accents to the dancing to the guitars - every detail has been thought through. Special commendation&nbsp;must go to Tara Young playing Mary Delgado, Frankie&rsquo;s wife and mother of his children, and Joel Elferink who plays camp music producer,Bob Crewe, both bringing a change of pace and comedic flair to the show.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stage itself is sparse but effective, utilising a raised walkway accessible by two spiral staircases. Various crucial set pieces are lowered to allow for the quick scene changes that are necessary. The use of colour and lighting is particularly fantastic. The New Jersey silhouette against the backlight sky is particularly effective, especially when paired with the chain link fence. The lighting perfectly complements the mood onstage and adds colour and fun to the raw metal of the set. Whilst some scenes like the &lsquo;December, 1963&rsquo; and &lsquo;My Eyes Adored You&rsquo; are visually excellent, it seems that more focus was put into some songs and not others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decision to put the drummer onstage is an interesting one. Sitting upstage centre on a platform that moves around the stage, he is at times distracting, pulling the focus from the storyline. This production has very effectively coordinated their musicians into the fabric of the show, having them appear and play onstage in various scenes throughout.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The costume could be a tricky thing to make exciting in this particular setting, given the majority of choice for the cast consists of 60s suits. However the move from rag-tag New Jersey boys to sell-out musical stars is easily mapped through their increasingly more glam suit jackets: from golf polos to the iconic red jackets to sleek black with glitter adored collars.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of screen projections within the production is good, explaining more of the story through historically appropriate pop art stills; alluding to famous works of the time by the likes of Roy Lichtenstein. The use of &lsquo;videos&rsquo; of &lsquo;the four seasons&rsquo; and old footage from music audiences is at times a bit jarring to the narrative but nonetheless a fun modern addition on the play, injecting more colour into the set. Similarly a few of the set pieces were standout - namely the recording studio window and the Crewe&rsquo;s yellow sofa - the less believable being the car and cushioned armchair. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The performances of the four leads at times could be subdued, but this created a relaxed atmosphere. Toning down the razzle-dazzle often found in musical theatre suited the storyline and audience.

With barely a moment of respite, its characters&rsquo; personal conflicts pulse with both transnational and gender tensions. The text is grounded and pertinent, and the performances commendable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Set over the span of one evening, the story follows Jay, a larger than life American actor (played with almost infuriating energy and lasciviousness by Darrel D&rsquo;Silva) hired to play a Catholic nationalist in Northern Ireland in a new West End play. His tensions with the work&rsquo;s feisty playwright, played by Lucianne McEvoy, are central to the conflict of the work. Similar to Ireland&rsquo;s other renowned work, <em>Cyprus Avenue</em>, it is perhaps questionable that the story revolves around a controversial white man when minority perspectives remain rare on stage. However, <em>Ulster American</em> is without a doubt an interesting commentary on post-MeToo,&nbsp;attitudes and the fakery of such powerful men hiding behind phony liberalism. One particular scene in which Jay and the play&rsquo;s middle-aged white male director discuss the Bechdel test comes to mind. The two noisily speak over each other, mansplaining&nbsp;the feminist theory; Jay even insists that &quot;Bechdel was a man&quot;.&nbsp;Each has adopted the lingo of the popular movement without taking its messages to heart, thereby remaining as flawed as their more outwardly sexist predecessors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Ireland&rsquo;s narrative at times veers towards the absurd, I found myself baffled at how he managed to capture almost word for word frustrating conversations I have been privy to within the past two weeks. It captures the strange contradictions within a world beginning to recognise longstanding corruption within itself while perpetrators refuse to acknowledge their proximity to the issue. The production is not without its fair share of uncomfortable laughs, some of which a little too uncomfortable for my personal taste, but it remains a relevant and aptly depicted social commentary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\"><em>Ulster American</em> runs at the Traverse Theatre until Saturday 2nd March 2019.</span></p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2019-02-24 14:26:37', '2019-02-24 14:26:37', 'ulster-american-review', 3, NULL, 1),

As the loved-up Molly and Sam move into a new apartment, it seems that their life together is just starting. But tragedy strikes as Sam is shot dead in the street, leaving Molly all alone. But Sam &ndash; trapped between this world and the next &ndash; discovers that perhaps his death was not coincidental, and that Molly is in danger. With the help of a (apparently not-so) fake psychic, Sam must change the course of the living world in order to facilitate his own entry into the next.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nick Richings&#39; lighting design is unrestricted in its opportunity to transcend the world we are used to, but unfortunately relies on incongruous gimmicks to represent the blur between life and death. A mirage of rippling hues unintentionally seems to locate the scenes of New York underwater, and the decision to illuminate the skyline upstage with crass neon lights is reminiscent of a school disco.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choreography by Alistair David is clearly intended to be modern &ndash; taking the mould of abstract ensemble movements that aim to contextualise the sappiness of the narrative in urban, grittier peripheries. In the blur of manual set changes required by a touring production, however, it soon becomes out of place &ndash; not dissimilar to intentionally &lsquo;edgy&rsquo; stereotypes encompassing teenage acting showcases.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, there are strong individual performances from Rebekah Lowing&rsquo;s Molly, who shines past the confines of the production design and holds the inconsistencies of tone together with the sheer power of her voice. Niall Sheehy as Sam is equally impressive, bringing a sentimentality to a character with whom we have had no time to connect, rendering his death a tragedy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With an enjoyable &ndash; if perhaps indistinguishable &ndash; gentle rock soundtrack from Dave Stewart and Glen Ballard to round everything off, the production makes for a gentle and pleasant evening, but whether or not it will live on beyond its expiration as strongly as its protagonists is yet to be decided. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">Ghost&nbsp;</span></em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">runs at the Festival Theatre until Saturday 2nd March 2019.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2019-02-27 22:06:05', '2019-02-27 22:06:05', 'ghost-review', 3, NULL, 1),

Angela Hardie is as convincing as heart-breaking in her negotiation of such an unchartered emotional terrain. Her unassuming relatability serves to confront the audience with their own rhetoric potential &ndash; forcing them to place themselves in the situation and to consider their own approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matthew Seager&rsquo;s script is nuanced and moving; excellently portraying the emotional rhetoric that surrounds the medical diagnosis, both for Arthur and Jane &ndash; both affected but equally alone because of it. He is similarly impressive in his portrayal of Arthur, and effortlessly manipulates the demarcated boundaries of chronology to present Arthur in many stages of life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a hollow beauty to the moments in which Frank Sinatra&rsquo;s music plays, when Will Alder and Iida Aino&rsquo;s lighting design starkly represents a change in narrative &ndash; taking us back to Jane and Arthur&rsquo;s early days together, before the diagnosis of MCI (mild cognitive impairment) challenged their future together. As their demeanour changes, we are allowed to get to know the individuals on their own terms: separated from the labels of the disease that too often works to define people.

But when the star entertainer becomes pregnant, aspiring philanthropist Baby Houseman does all she can to help &ndash; even if that involves learning how to dance and taking to the stage so her friend can take the time off for medical assistance. As the sweat begins to form and the day of the performance approaches, Baby finds herself entranced by her new partner, Johnny. As their relationship progresses and familial tensions rise, anything is possible but only one thing is certain &ndash; nobody puts Baby in a corner.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roberto Comotti&rsquo;s cartoonish set design aptly contextualises the viscid insipidness of the American Summer ideology &ndash; with a picture-perfect caricature of the Kellerman&rsquo;s restaurant taking centre stage amongst an over-green and perfectly manicured forest. Though Valerio Tiberi&rsquo;s projection design has similar qualities, it soon ventures into the absurdist: in particular, the infamous lake scene (realized through carefully positioned back lighting and a cartoon lake projected onto the upstage scrim) is made laughable through the childish qualities of its aesthetics.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With such a large ensemble cast, there is a certain disappointment in the under-utilization of their talents. With a distinct lack of singing, there is no compensation afforded by an increased frequency of full-stage dance numbers. In fact, scenes are largely fragmented &ndash; with clunky set pieces brought on for inconsequential segments of narrative to play out.

That version of the play was updated for a modern audience, and this version, directed by Shilpa T-Hyland and ending a short tour at Edinburgh&rsquo;s Studio Theatre is similarly adapted, this time by Zinnie Harris, who grounds the classic in 1920s Scotland amid the General Strike which affected the entirety of the UK. Jen McGinley&rsquo;s set draws the audience in even before the performance begins, as does Hyland&rsquo;s decision to place the brilliant Helen Mackay, playing Christine, visibly on stage as we enter, establishing firmly her social position before any words have even been said. The set itself also establishes the sense of social hierarchy which is so key to the plot, with the supposed grandeur of the house above contrasting with the claustrophobia of the kitchen amidst the visible servant bells and domestic utensils.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a slightly slow start, the vast majority of the acting in this three-hander is focussed and fast-paced, particularly during the brief moments when all three characters appear at the same time, when John&rsquo;s mixed loyalties are fascinating to observe. As John, Lorn Macdonald is for most part enthralling, although at a couple of moments seems perhaps to lack total authenticity. Macdonald plays John&rsquo;s youthful masculinity well, however it is the moments of vulnerability where he is at his best. Similarly, Hiftu Quasem is sincere and often compelling as the title role, playing a Julie who entices confidently but is at the same time unsure of herself and of what she wants. It is definitely Mackay, however, who stands out, portraying a Christine whose unwavering emotional intelligence and composure resonates with the audience far more than the unpredictability and irresponsibility of the other two characters. It would be easy to play Christine as angry and bitter, but Mackay&rsquo;s earnest characterisation suggests something far deeper than this that resounds even after the curtain has come down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris&rsquo; adaptation for the majority of the evening serves to give the play a confident new life, finding a voice which not only reflects 1920s struggles but highlights themes which are still relevant today. Despite this, there are a few moments which seem perhaps to be slightly miscalculated; particularly the repeated throwing of a wet cloth at Julie, which seems out of place somehow in a script which at all other times conveys convincingly the passions of the individuals involved. This adaptation, then, for the most part enthrals, and at just over an hour and a half makes for a pacey and thoroughly enjoyable evening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">Miss Julie&nbsp;</span></em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">runs at The Studio until Saturday 9th March 2019.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2019-03-08 16:22:14', '2019-03-08 16:22:14', 'miss-julie-review', 3, NULL, 1),

When the Angels decide to close Heaven so that they may have unshared access to its glories, it seems the dead are left in limbo. But when the whiskey is flowing and the band is playing &ndash; who would choose to reside anywhere other than the soil?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plot follows the narrative of the youthfully-dead John (Malcolm Cumming), whose untimely death is devastatingly clouded by historical&nbsp;legislation&nbsp;that outlawed his love for then-boyfriend:&nbsp;now, an old man who still makes daily visits to John&rsquo;s grave. Guided by the sharp-tongued but ultimately compassionate dealings of Mrs. Mark (Ann Louise Ross), John enlists the help of new resident Little Annie (Olivia Barrowclough) to make contact with the world above and bring closure to the man whose unfounded guilt has haunted him for a lifetime.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kenneth MacLeod&rsquo;s set design is as morbid as it is delectable, presenting the soil as a topsy-turvy amalgamation of Victorian steampunk coffins and household ornaments. High above the cold depths of the earth stands a neon-rimmed&nbsp;window, affording glimpses into the living world and the heights of Heaven as though through a TV screen. The grandeur of the set comes not only from its size: instead, there are a myriad of interesting and unusual levels that make for a particularly interesting use of staging. Accompanied by Simon Wilkinson&rsquo;s&rsquo; equally innovative lighting design, the entire production is enchanted by a hauntingly intriguing aesthetic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biff Smith has a great deal of expectation preceding him &ndash; as the leader (and songwriter) of the soil&rsquo;s resident band, he is tasked with bringing life to an otherwise particularly dead locality. His headship is at once charismatic and unnerving: with his purple-lipped jazzy vocals contextualising our induction into the afterlife and the cadaverous ventures of its inhabitants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dark Carnival is a masterful representation of the power of gig theatre; guiding us into the dark and cobwebbed ground below which we stand. Defiant in its morbidity and triumphant in its execution &ndash; it would seem&nbsp;that perhaps death isn&rsquo;t the end, after all.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">The Dark Carnival&nbsp;</span></em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">runs at the Traverse Theatre until Saturday 9th March 2019.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2019-03-09 18:31:15', '2019-03-09 18:31:15', 'the-dark-carnival-review', 3, NULL, 1),

And what&rsquo;s not to smile about? Her now month-old album &#39;Good At Falling&#39; has achieved large commercial and critical successes, taking her work to new heights having spent 4 years releasing assorted EPs and singles.

It&rsquo;s a dynamic that differs incredibly from listening alone, a powerful testament to the sheer depth of emotion attached to Bain&rsquo;s lyrics with their carefully crafted soundscapes, made even more ethereal as they fill the beautiful stone arches of The Caves. And Amber seems to be enjoying herself as much as the spectators, cheekily smiling and occasionally twisting her mic so that the youthful throng at the front can be heard belting out everything from infectious banger &#39;Maybe You&rsquo;re The Reason&#39; to the slower and slightly more reflective rendition of &#39;Saw You In A Dream&#39;. A particular highlight would be an almost effortless transition from the eerie yet intricate introduction of &#39;Sister&#39; into newer track &#39;Everybody Hates Me Now&#39;, a beautifully poignant piece that is as introspective and emotive as The Japanese House have ever been, and as familiar to the crowd as any older track.</font></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0px\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"margin:0px\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt; margin:0px\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\"><font color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0px\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"margin:0px\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt; margin:0px\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\"><font color=\"#000000\">The eloquence with which older and more recent tracks combine within the set is outstanding, highlighting an emotional maturity that has developed through her four EPs and particularly now in her new album, a work that largely deals with coping with the struggles of heartbreak.

The two unite live in concert by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Matthew Freeman, and a 4k Ultra HD LED screen. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">Glasgow&rsquo;s SSE Hydro was the ideal venue, beyond its own watery nomenclature. We were greeted with a giant revolving projection of the endlessly blue planet. From the darkness colours exploded onto the screen, as the orchestra erupted into its cinematic introduction.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">I sat mouth agape for most of the performance. The live music only heightened the suspense of the footage, which had already left me on the edge of my seat watching from my flat&rsquo;s 24-inch screen. We meet saddleback clownfish working in teams to move a giant shell. Their black and white appearance is accompanied by equally eerie music. Yet, when the female finally lays her bright eggs (much closer to the infamous Nemo-orange), the orchestra is lit in a matching hue, responding with triumphant fanfare. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">The tension continually grows. Giant trevally launch themselves from the water to swallow fledgling birds whole. Hunting orca render their prey unconscious with a co-ordinated hammer blows. A lion fish is snatched into the abyss by a Bobbit worm, rising like a <i>Little Shop of Horrors </i>plant from the violins to consume its prey. As the fish blow on to the sand, directly onto the band below, the woodwind replies in kind. It&rsquo;s a moment of perfect audio and visual unity. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">Zimmer&rsquo;s seamless transitions between moods narrate the creatures&rsquo; storylines, each theme layered in anticipation of the next change. We question whether the music or footage was created first (our suspicions confirmed, it&rsquo;s the latter), as the two fit together so perfectly. In keeping with the audio-visual harmony, the audience unites behind the more courageous creatures. The crowd raucously cheers when a puffin escapes an epic dogfight with a skua over a piece of fish to feed its pufflings. Keen Attenboroughers are reminded of the &lsquo;iguana vs. snakes&rsquo; moment from <i>Planet Earth II. </i></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">Despite Rani&rsquo;s best efforts, Attenborough&rsquo;s narrative absence was certainly felt. We agree a more vocally-distinctive narrator might have better filled the void left by the voice of the series. Nevertheless, the series&rsquo; overarching message of human responsibility certainly hits home. The production follows sustainable practices, promoting recyclable &lsquo;Just Water&rsquo; bottles and reducing CO2 emissions from their tour vehicles.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">Perhaps the most impressive moment takes place in the darkest depths of the ocean, featuring the now infamous &lsquo;brine pool of death&rsquo;. It looks like outer space &ndash; Rani reminds us that four times more people have visited the moon than waters so deep. This scene especially stands out for its superbly co-ordinated staging, tech, and lighting. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">Amidst calls for &lsquo;one more tuna&rsquo;, the orchestra encores to the triumphant flute trills synonymous with the series soundtrack, haunting live choral singing, and the giant blue orb.

This conversation between the Scottish National Jazz Orchestra and Arild Andersen, Tommy Smith and Paolo Vinaccia, over 4 different pieces, really showcased the explorations of contemporary jazz. </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-52e56043-7fff-2d15-a7c4-46a85d4b200b\">Arild Andersen began the story with a beautiful composition of bass harmonics; the Scottish National Jazz Orchestra gradually weaved its way into the sound before unleashing its full force. The real excitement, however, came with the array of fantastic solos, the first of these being on the trombone. All I can say is who would have thought the trombone would be capable of a bebop-esque scat? The speed and melody he brought to the trombone was unreal and I&rsquo;ve never seen someone get so many notes out of a trombone so quickly. To follow was an amazing percussion solo: if you&rsquo;ve ever been given the shaker to play in the school orchestra and thought it was a dud role, percussionist Paolo Vinaccia will most definitely make you think again. This insane percussion solo, performed using only his hands, involving a one minute interlude using only a shaker, was mastery and the dramatic interplay between him and the bass made for a mesmerizing climax to their performance. </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-52e56043-7fff-2d15-a7c4-46a85d4b200b\">The only thing I could critique would be the venue: it felt as though it didn&rsquo;t do such an exciting performance justice and perhaps a more playful venue would have better complimented the excitement of the performance. It felt a bit like watching Nirvana play at the Royal Opera House: jazz isn&rsquo;t something old and fragile and shouldn&rsquo;t be treated as something that is. Perhaps, maybe, this is a reason why not many young people aren&rsquo;t or think they aren&rsquo;t in to jazz, which is a shame. So, maybe a more relaxed venue would have attracted a more mixed crowd. </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-52e56043-7fff-2d15-a7c4-46a85d4b200b\">Overall, it was a wonderfully back-to-front masterpiece where the trumpets and piano held the beat , whilst the bassist and the trombonist took centre stage and showed us what amazing rhythmic and melodic talent their instruments are capable of. It had the charm of classical jazz whilst being enticing and contemporary at the same time. </b></p>\r\n', 196, 1, '2019-03-30 16:45:20', '2019-03-30 17:36:56', 'norse-myths-featuring-arild-andersen-tommy-smith-patrice-heral', NULL, NULL, 0),

Matilda is a genius and without an appropriate outlet for her intelligence, finds herself able to move things with her eyes. Matilda&rsquo;s tale is intertwined with that of an acrobat and his wife which leads to many a plot twist in the second act.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whilst the show is based on Roald Dahl&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s book, it is certainly enjoyable for adults as well, with the opening number, &#39;Miracle&#39;, immediately engages the humour of all generations in the audience. The child actors are exceptionally talented and steal the show; at many points outshining the adult actors. Scarlett Cecil as Matilda, despite being tiny in comparison to the huge theatre, commands full attention of the audience in her first solo, &#39;Naughty&#39;, and continues to shine throughout the rest of the production. The other children are also very impressive: especially Toby Hales as Eric and Lily Van Veer as Lavender.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amongst the grown-ups, Elliot Harper plays frightening-but-witty Miss Trunchbull. The characterisation of Miss Trunchbull is somewhat reminiscent of a pantomime style if more sophisticated, affording the audience both laughter and grimace. Rebecca Thornhill and Sebastian Torkia successfully capture the essence of Matilda&rsquo;s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood, who are very much caricatures in their dominating personas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the children are exceptionally talented singers and dancers. They stand out in every number, but special mention must go to the song &#39;Revolting Children&#39;, in which their talents are truly showcased. Peter Darling&#39;s outstanding choreography makes the show what it is, and with the visual talents of Hugh Vanstone in his lighting design, <em>Matilda The Musical</em> is a delight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">Matilda The Musical&nbsp;</span></em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">runs at the Edinburgh Playhouse until Saturday 27th April 2019.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2019-04-11 21:46:00', '2019-04-17 10:00:01', 'matilda-the-musical-review', 3, NULL, 1),

It seems he has it all figured out; but navigating first-impressions at a new job is somewhat tricky when you are a gay man with cerebral palsy. Oh, and he has just been hit by a car.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a lunch-date with new co-worker (and soon-to-be spirit animal) Kim (Punam Patel), Ryan begins to discuss his accident when Kim puts the pieces together &ndash; a skewed limp when walking and a vehicular collision? Got it. In fact, so seamless is the connection that there really is no need to explain in more detail why his hand-eye coordination doesn&rsquo;t lend itself well to opening letters. Besides &ndash; cerebral palsy doesn&rsquo;t define a person, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Special</em> is a refreshingly sophisticated look at intersectionality and millennial culture. As a semi-autobiographical piece, creator and actor Ryan O&rsquo;Connell brings a unique and unrivalled honesty to his performance &ndash; navigating the pitfalls of prejudice with nuance and pride. He defies the norm through his depiction of <em>that</em> sex scene; portraying queer relations without the cinematic heteronormativity intrinsic to the classic moonlit pan-away camera movement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So truthful are his observations that the blind date scene with his boss&rsquo; deaf cousin makes for ecstatic viewing. When Ryan is confronted by disability, he is taken aback at the audacity to pair two people together in such a (clearly) discriminatory way. But when the concept of internalized ableism is thrown at Ryan in response to his questionable behaviour, he is forced to face his own preconceptions. He has cerebral palsy &ndash; surely that makes him immune or something?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With astonishingly profound character development, <em>Special</em> ventures where no other show has done before. Witty, bold and triumphant from its concept through its execution: if TV has a canon, add it to the list. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">Special&nbsp;</span></em><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd;\">is available to stream on Netflix now.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n', 200, 1, '2019-04-17 09:58:40', '2019-04-17 10:04:39', 'special-review', 3, NULL, 1);

(2, 'FAQs', '<p><strong>Q. I can&rsquo;t make my show this week. What should I do?</strong><br />\r\nA. We have a 3 strike policy for missing shows- if you get 3 strikes, FreshAir&#39;s committee will consider taking your show off the schedule. If you need to miss your show, let the Head of Programming know in advance&nbsp;(programming@freshair.org.uk) and then post in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/415654968533282\">FreshAir Members facebook group</a> asking for someone to cover you. If you cover someone else&#39;s show you will earn back a strike as compensation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q. Where can I access show recordings?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A. Recordings are automatically added to our Google Drive, available <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Xcup64X129d-JXYC32k5B9ZN6FKEI2W6\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q. How do I make a Broadcast Controls log-in for my show?&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nA.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://freshair.org.uk/users/sign_up\">Click here</a>, fill in your details and make sure to select your show from the drop-down menu.<br />\r\nYou will get a confirmation email with a link to confirm your account (this may wind up in your spam inbox so have a look)! Any trouble, email webmaster@freshair.org.uk</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q. What is the studio door code?</strong><br />\r\nA. If you have a show, you should have been emailed this before broadasting started!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q. What is the log-in for the studio computer?</strong><br />\r\nA. Username is .\\freshair and the password is freshair</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q. How do I go on-air?</strong><br />\r\nA. Open the Broadcast Controls app on the desktop, sign in with your email address, and then select your show. Click the image in the left toolbar to go live!<br />\r\nNB: if you are leaving the studio, and no one is on after you, make sure to go off-air again!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q. Where can I find the jingles?</strong><br />\r\nA. If you open Cartwall and there are no jingles, click &#39;Load Set&#39;, go to the Jingles folder and select the Cartwall file.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q. Where can I find Top of the Hour?</strong><br />\r\nA. Top of the Hour should load itself into mAirlist at 5 mins before the hour- you just play it like a normal track. If you still need to find it, it&#39;s on the desktop- just drag it into mAirlist!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q.&nbsp;What do I do if mAirlist crashes?</strong><br />\r\nA. Unfortunately this does happen! Relaunch mAirlist and in the meantime, chat to fill the silence or play a song through Windows Media Player with the PC1 fader up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q. What do I do if there is a problem with broadcasting and I can&#39;t go on-air?</strong><br />\r\nUnfortunately this also happens from time to time. If this happens, record your show using Audacity (like you did with your demo!). You can then upload it to a Mixcloud account, or send it to marketing@freshair.org.uk and ask our Head of Marketing to post it on FreshAir&#39;s Mixcloud!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q. How many people are listening to my show?</strong><br />\r\nA. We don&rsquo;t make listening figures available because we believe that student radio should be about creativity and gaining experience, not ego! But bear in mind that your show is going out in union buildings which see a huge amount of students through the doors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q. I need DJs for an event. Can anyone at FreshAir do it?</strong><br />\r\nA. Speak to our Head of Events (events@freshair.org.uk) or post in our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/399654840165837\">Events Facebook group</a>&nbsp;and can spread the word on your event to get appropriate DJs based on availability, genre etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q. I really want to go to this training event but I&rsquo;m not sure I can afford it. Can FreshAir help?</strong><br />\r\nA. FreshAir has a discretionary fund available to fund members looking to go to training events that have been publicised by the station. We can&rsquo;t give you the whole amount and funding is at the discretion of treasurer and manager based on a number of factors, but we might be able to help you out. Get in touch with manager@freshair.org.uk for help.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any other questions?

There is a red light above the studio door that remains on while presenters are talking, and switches off when music is being played.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>You must tidy up the studio after your show.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>If something breaks accidentally, please report it to the teach team &ndash; we won&rsquo;t charge people for accidents, but we really do need to know about it as soon as possible!</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Please appreciate that we only have one live studio &ndash; so shows are always liable to be disrupted, for example if we need to do some essential repair work or fit in an exciting guest or one-off broadcast.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>VERY IMPORTANT RULES&hellip;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>No swearing on air. This is a complicated one, so you must use your common sense based on these guidelines. There&rsquo;s no complete list of words you cannot say; the point is that you must not be offensive, bearing in mind who could be listening. Think before you speak. Yes, at night, it&rsquo;s probably not a problem to say &lsquo;bloody&rsquo;, for example. But it&rsquo;s not ok to knowingly use an arguably inoffensive word in the wrong context &ndash; for example you can&rsquo;t say &ldquo;cock&rdquo; all the time and then innocently pretend you were talking about poultry. Conclusion: use your common sense, and don&rsquo;t swear &ndash; it makes us sound unprofessional as a station and is never necessary.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>No talking about or commenting on the adverts or sponsors. Ever. It&rsquo;s unprofessional and they are likely to pull their adverts, costing the station money.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>No food or drink in the studio. The only exceptions to this are bottles of water that you drink well away from the equipment. You are especially not allowed alcohol.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>No smoking in the studio. Not even a cheeky toke out the window. Don&rsquo;t be lazy, just go outside!</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Please respect all the equipment in the studio, and leave things as you found them. Especially please do not change any of the settings on either of the computers, or press random buttons on the desk!!</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NEVER GO INTO THE STUDIO OUTSIDE OF OUR BROADCASTING HOURS WITHOUT PERMISSION. The studio and all of Pleasance has webcams recording 24hrs a day so we will see anyone breaking this rule and you will have your show pulled &ndash; no second chances.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NEVER REMOVE ANYTHING FROM THE STUDIO WITHOUT PERMISSION.

Below is information about each scheme and some of the top tips we picked up on the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Journalism Trainee Scheme</em><br />\r\n- &ldquo;The BBC Academy&rsquo;s gold standard 12-month journalism traineeship, comprising paid training and work placements in the BBC&rsquo;s UK newsrooms, working in online, radio and TV, with mentoring from a senior BBC journalist&rdquo;<br />\r\n- Open now, closes 7th February</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Production Trainee Scheme</em><br />\r\n- &ldquo;The BBC Academy&rsquo;s gold standard 12-month fast-track production traineeship, comprising paid training and work placements across the UK in TV and radio, along with mentoring from a BBC Senior Manager. It has a fantastic record of retention in the industry&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Production Talent Pool</em><br />\r\n- &ldquo;The BBC Academy&rsquo;s 12-month entry-level talent pool for aspiring production talent. If chosen, you are eligible for short term contracts supporting a wide range of BBC programmes and teams across the UK as production needs arise. Everyone accepted into the pool is considered for the Production Trainee Scheme which recruits later in the year<br />\r\n- Applications open 3rd-14th March</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Application Tips</em><br />\r\n- To apply, use the BBC Academy website - you need to make a profile on the BBC Careers Hub, which is a good idea anyway, even if you&rsquo;re not applying this year.<br />\r\n- Talk about&nbsp;<strong>what you&rsquo;re proud of rather than who you are</strong>&nbsp;- an easy way to do this is to think &lsquo;less adjectives, more verbs&rsquo; when writing an application.<br />\r\n- Think about transferable skills - it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily matter if you don&rsquo;t have a lot of media experience, as long as you can illustrate what the experience you do have has taught you and how it can be transferred to a media role.<br />\r\n- When talking about projects/achievements, use the STAR method (you can google this for more information) -&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>ituation &gt;&nbsp;<strong>T</strong>ask &gt;&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>ction &gt;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>esult<br />\r\n- One question will ask you to review a BBC show - don&rsquo;t be afraid to be critical! And make sure you look at the BBC Editorial Policy, available online&nbsp;<br />\r\n- You will need to do situational judgement, in which you are faced with scenarios and have to pick an action - mostly they&rsquo;re looking for people who are team players and easy to get along with<br />\r\n- You will also be asked to pitch a show idea in some applications - be succinct, clear and make sure the show is easily visualised when you read back over the pitch. Talk about why it is important/relevant. Mention who your audience will be and think about the implications of this (i.e. easy just to pick &lsquo;students&rsquo; because that&rsquo;s what you know, but are you cutting off too big a chunk of potential audience with that? Justify why not)<br />\r\n- Entertainment or factual shows are generally easier to pitch because of their format - the structure of comedy etc can be difficult to visualise and sell&nbsp;<br />\r\n- When asked about a creative project that you&rsquo;re proud of, focus on&nbsp;<strong>your</strong>&nbsp;role - don&rsquo;t be too modest! Get around a fear of sounding arrogant by being very factual in your description - again,&nbsp;<strong>verbs not adjectives</strong>. And remember, the project doesn&rsquo;t have to be in media as long as you justify it and show transferrable skills!<br />\r\n- Sounds obvious but be yourself - don&rsquo;t go into the application thinking that the BBC are looking for a certain type of person because they&rsquo;re not. Fakers are easy to spot!<br />\r\n- If you get through the initial applications process you will be asked to do a verbal reasoning test based on some very complex pieces of writing - practice for this by reading news outside of your comfort zone, Financial Times etc which are complex and heavy. When you sit the test, don&rsquo;t worry that it seems very fast or that you run out of time - this happens to everybody, don&rsquo;t panic!<br />\r\n- Keep an eye on the BBC College of Production and College of Journalism websites for more tips and opportunities as they arise, and make sure you follow @BBCTrainees on Twitter and feel free to tweet them questions!<br />\r\n- Re: social media, be mindful of what you are putting into a public forum. Everyone who wants a media career needs to have twitter, but always remember it is public! If you want to go into political journalism especially, be careful about outspoken political opinions as you don&rsquo;t want a programme to be accused of bias.<br />\r\n- In the age of the internet, there&rsquo;s no excuse not to be putting yourself out there with writing, podcasts, short films etc. If you don&rsquo;t have this on your CV, potential employers will wonder why when it doesn&rsquo;t take anything these days to just start producing content.</p>\r\n', 2, '2017-06-21 10:36:37', '2017-06-21 10:39:14', 'workshops-and-training', NULL),

This past year I have been an avid member of the Music and news team while also my running my own show. I am applying to be secretary next year as I wish to have a more close relationship to the freshair team and want to help a society I love. My previous job was social media manager for a company so i feel this role will suit me perfectly.&nbsp; I will be an organised, dedicated member over the freshair community. As secretary I will attempt to create a seamless organization of freshair to help the ever-growing society with new members and old. From working on the News team last year i know what it is like to have to write articles with a small amount of notice due to the quick turnaround of news stories and so can handle the stress entailed with organising things in a fast time period. As your Secretary I will attempt to create a freshair background environment so the rest of the society feels looked after and like they only need to worry about what their role entails and nothing else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Production Manager </strong>- <em>Br&oacute;nagh Grace</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hello!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My name&rsquo;s Br&oacute;nagh and I&rsquo;m running to be FreshAir&rsquo;s new Production Manager A little about me I make pretty good banana bread,which I&rsquo;d be willing to bring to production meetings (outside the studiot!). I got a radio alarm fro mr twelfth birthday because I wanted to wake up to the radio because I was already that in love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experience:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>I&#39;ve been involved with FreshAir since the beginning of this year when I started my own show, Stories. I invite guests on to talk about their work and receive stories and song choices from listeners all around, a different theme each week. So ar there have been live poetry readings (in English and Occitan), professional Scottish storytelling and a musician playing live in the studio.</li>\r\n	<li>I&#39;ve been a member of the production team since the start of the year, producing feminist chat show In Awe of Mn&aacute; in first semester and Mind Yourself, a show discussing mental health, this semester I&rsquo;ve worked in multiple people-facing roles and event and I currently work in PR.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>What I&rsquo;d love to do:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Make FreshAir jingle and continue jingle making workshops, holding them at the stat of the start of each semester</li>\r\n	<li>Complete at least one major production project per semester - either a radio play or documentary so producers can get more hands-on experience with greater control over content</li>\r\n<li>More production training: planning, pre-recordings, sound effects, etc.</li>\r\n	<li>Enable shows to book a producer for extra jingle-making or one-off projects.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Production Manager </strong>-<em> Michael Forward</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hey there, my name is Michael and I have been a member of FreshAir and its Production Team for the last two years, winning the Producer of the Year award for 2018. I am running to take over the role of Production Manager and would like to continue the growth of the team and its importance within the station. As the scope of FreshAir increases I believe the Production Team will be incredibly useful and would like to focus on:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Technical knowhow &mdash; I would like the Production Team to become a safe place for people to learn about sound recording and audio editing. These are useful skills and would allow the team to assist the station with recording/editing interviews, podcasts, and the upcoming Wee Sessions.</li>\r\n	<li>Jingles &mdash; Custom jingles can really help a show stand out, and it&rsquo;s one of the most fun ways for a producer to get involved with the show they&rsquo;re assigned to. I would like the whole team to understand the basics of making a jingle and how to make them sound professional with whatever resources they have available.</li>\r\n	<li>Production as service &mdash; I am keen to continue matching producers and shows one-to-one, but would like to create a help request form for shows that do not have a producer yet may need assistance for a specific broadcast e.g. live music, working the deck while presenter DJs etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I am confident I have the experience and commitment to be your Production Manager.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Programming Manager</strong> - <em>Rianna Andrews</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hey I&rsquo;m Rianna, and I&rsquo;m running again for the position of Head of Programming! Going in to my final year at university, I would like to continue my role as head of programming and being a member of the committee as I have thoroughly enjoyed it. I would like to continue to oversee the growth of our exciting, brand new Studio 2 and curate shows that are broadcast daily in our On Air studio too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I found that in my role, I have overcome some challenges that have been involved in organising the studio&rsquo;s schedule and hope to find ways of more effectively arranging the shows according to the availability of our members. I feel like the vetting process can be improved also to make sure that members who want to have their own shows are able to demonstrate their enthusiasm in creating them and the exciting concepts they may have, in order to suitably match them with producers who share their interests; improving the high standard of content that we are already producing at FreshAir. I also want to find more ways to make our On &amp; Off-Air broadcasting more accessible to people who may want to get into radio, something which I hope to build on from my previous year in this role from the connections I made with other societies for our special broadcast events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I really love FreshAir, which I believe is shown through my hard-working nature and desire to help make our society the best it can be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Marketing Manager</strong> - <em>Felix Rackow</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Marketing Manager for freshair.org.uk, my main goal would be to increase cross-promotion of shows. I think the quality of the content produced really speaks for itself, and so I propose a forum where members are able to share what is coming up on their shows, for others to promote. This information could also perhaps be compiled into a weekly jingle (&lsquo;This Week On Freshair&rsquo;) to be played out during the week, could be displayed on the screens in EUSA venues, or even compiled into a weekly public mailing list. If presenters&rsquo; friends and family tune in to one show for an hour a week, then more cross-promotion would be really useful to increase overall listenership. I think that social media marketing is also really important for the Freshair brand, and I would love to figure out a way of allowing members to directly post promotional material for their own shows on our pages. I also love the idea of guerrilla marketing, particularly to students who share everything online &ndash; this would be an entertaining way to promote the station and get people talking. With regards to my personal suitability for the role; I have experience in social media marketing, having used software such as TweetDeck to promote shows at a local theatre during a two week placement. I also have experience marketing a radio station, having helped to promote my local station (Wandsworth Radio) at various events, as well as promoting my own show on their social media feeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Events Manager</strong> - <em>Carly Beehler</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am applying for the position of Events Manager at FreshAir because of my love of the station and my past experience. As Head of Music this year, I organised the Nina Nesbitt Meet and Greet. This was extremely successful for ourselves, and was equally as successful for Nesbitt herself, as we got more than double the expected turn out. In addition to this, I organised the weekly Music Team meetings. I absolutely loved putting these together and would truly enjoy organising more events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aims:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Work to widen the breadth of FreshAir events by doing more with professionals (interviews, concerts, performances, etc.)</li>\r\n	<li>Increasing the involvement of other media societies by encouraging collaboration with our events (i.e. EUTV filming performances)</li>\r\n	<li>Continue the amazing work on our club nights - these are super successful and a great display of the awesomeness of FreshAir</li>\r\n	<li>Continue to organise the beautiful night that is Media Ball. I would love to be the FreshAir representative to lend help in creating an event everyone, from all societies, can feel involved with and enjoy</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Through my experience at FreshAir I have found I genuinely love putting together events. I am extremely organised and hard working, as proven by my time as Head of Music. I have also developed wonderful professional contacts, and in general learned how to conduct myself within a professional atmosphere. I am very excited to be running for this role because I love FreshAir and all it does!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Training Manager</strong> - <em>Matthew Sedman</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have really enjoyed my time as Head of Arts this last year, and my love for the society has grown. I would really like the opportunity to have a go at the position of &#39;Head of Training&#39; because I think my skill set is suited towards a successful execution of this position, and because I think it will give me valuable insight into a potential career future. Having conducted a couple of training sessions at the start of Semester 1, I feel confident that I will be able to implement a concise and accessible training programme for all members. I would like to centralise the handbook (in terms of its accessibility online and paper copies in the studio) as well as producing a &#39;cheat sheet&#39; for other committee members who are running training so there is cross-board consistency, I would like to implement a training plan for studio 2 that both trains people at the start of the year and makes it possible to join in later on (thus making the society even more welcoming) and I would like to take an active role in trying to alleviate some of the stress from the tech experts when it comes to answering queries regarding the equipment. I would also like to look into producing the aforementioned &#39;training videos&#39; - realistically, I don&#39;t know if this would be possible to complete in a year but I am keen to get the ball rolling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Head of Music</strong> - <em>Finn Marsden</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been part of the music team for two years now and it has grown to be my favourite part of the station. It&rsquo;s a brilliant opportunity for us like-minded music addicts to display our very different tastes in artists, whilst also having a place to socialise and get to know new people. Over the past year I have acted as Head of Training for FreshAir which has given me a real insight into how be part of the committee, as well as how a Head of Music should act in committee. I&rsquo;ve had the honour of seeing both Elinor and Carly as Heads of Music and I have loved to see the ideas that both have brought to the table. I know that as Head I could do the same by keeping the things that work so well as well as improving, updating and introducing brand new ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of my personal goals include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>To take suggestions and ideas from fellow music team members and see with my utmost effort that they can happen.</li>\r\n	<li>To ensure that new members are quickly integrated and settled into the group through the means of a two hour Music Team Pub Quiz during week 1/2 with lots and lots of music questions!</li>\r\n	<li>To push social media by posting regular updates on our various music team antics.</li>\r\n	<li>To continue to develop our incredible radio baby that is &lsquo;Wee Sessions&rsquo;.</li>\r\n	<li>To confer with the Head of Events to arrange a &lsquo;Wee Sessions Live&rsquo; night. The event will be a chance for local Edinburgh artists to come and play a few songs at a live music night. It will create a chance for local artists to use FreshAir as a platform to get their music heard, a superb way to help out the student community. It will also be a chance to get our brand out there. &nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>To confer with the Heads of Training and Arts to organise another Review/Interview workshop as this worked so so well!</li>\r\n	<li>If members of the music team are also presenting specialist music shows, I will give them the option to have their show tagged as a &lsquo;music team show&rsquo;. I will then coalesce these shows and advertise them through our various music team profiles.</li>\r\n	<li>The Music Team Hub show will continue to profile our top 10 new tracks of the week, but I will also invite specialist music presenters onto the programme to discuss and display their own shows. &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Head of Music</strong> - <em>Jessica Cave</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My name is Jessica, and I am running to be Head of Music next year. I am a dedicated Freshair member who has run a show since the beginning of the year and helped co-host a couple of my friends shows. I am a committed Newsteam member where I write articles each week and am the leader of the &lsquo;Arts&rsquo; section. I am also a Music team member where I review concerts and help review the music for each week. Both of these I believe displays my enthusiasm for the station. Carly&rsquo;s running of music team has been so enjoyable that part of my goals for next year would be to keep up the grounding in communal aspect and organisation she has put in place. But to further this, my main focus would be engaging an even broader audience in the music team. As head of music, I will incorporate the local music scene with a seamless connection to Freshair making it place for known for the hub of music in Edinburgh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, I will promote the music-team hub show by encouraging more guests and reviews to be read and discussed on air. I will also support more writing from the music team members to make the team about what individuals love. I will encourage if anyone feels passionate about music to write about it to create a larger online-sphere connected directly to the Fresh-air music team community.&nbsp; I also will introduce an artist of the month and moment which further gains the music-teams name and recognition as a place to find out about music. Lastly, I will launch social media such as Instagram directly for the music team to promote our reviews and articles to a broader and more accessible audience. Vote for me, and you will have an organised and proactive music team leader who wants to create encouraging a loving space for all to be involved!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Head of Music</strong> - <em>Kris Marcinkus</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m here to propose why I should be your next Head of Music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To begin with, I love music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, I&rsquo;ve already been a committee member. I was Head of Tech from 2017 to 2018. This means I know the way in which committee agenda should be conducted &ndash; common challenges, possible solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would like to get more live performances at Freshair &ndash; live or pre-recorded broadcasts from other locations &ndash; we could do this from, for example, the Alison House studios. Also, I&rsquo;m a Music and Music Tech student, therefore, I know the logistical and technical details of attempting something as such. I have ties to some promoters, bands. I&rsquo;ve helped put on club nights, recorded bands and during my few years in Edinburgh I&rsquo;ve come to know the music scene here reasonably well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would cover as many genres as possible (yes, even country) on the Music team radio show, inviting different people to feature on it. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;d start a music podcasting series &ndash; long-form talks with musicians in Edinburgh or beyond. This would range from classical composers to rock bands. Hopefully this would allow for the music team to reach a larger audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to be part of not only the committee community, but also to bring in as much activity from Freshair members to get involved with our initiatives that don&rsquo;t stop with simply doing their own show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m excited to build a music team and work together to make something we&rsquo;re proud of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Head of Arts</strong> - <em>Jelena Sofronijevic</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hello! I&rsquo;m Jelena, and I would love to be Head of Arts next year. I&rsquo;m keeping my manifesto as simple as ABC:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AMPLIFY ARTS&rsquo; VOICE</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Stronger social media presence.</li>\r\n	<li>We already have lots of online content, yet relatively little promo. I will establish a regular publishing schedule to advertise the HUB show, upcoming reviews, and other Arts-focussed FreshAir shows.</li>\r\n	<li>Refresh HUB Show.</li>\r\n	<li>Divide the show into regular weekly segments (&lsquo;Book of the Week&rsquo;, &lsquo;Play of the Week&rsquo;, etc.).</li>\r\n	<li>Feature more guests and interviews, including from other FreshAir shows and student societies.</li>\r\n	<li>Ensure all HUB shows are uploaded on Mixcloud within 48 hours.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>BROADER COVERAGE.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Following from Matthew, continue extending Arts coverage beyond theatre to literature, spoken word, film, and art.</li>\r\n	<li>I plan to do this by reaching out to more student societies (FilmSoc, LitSoc, etc.), as well as other Edinburgh-based groups.</li>\r\n	<li>Establish stronger links with Edinburgh&rsquo;s art galleries and museums, and arts venues in Glasgow.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>CONSCRIPT (NOT QUITE&hellip;).</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Attract more team members and reviewers through &lsquo;AMPLIFY&rsquo; measures.</li>\r\n	<li>Keep the Arts Facebook group updated with review opportunities using a sign-up spreadsheet (like Music).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve had a show on FreshAir for the last two years, as well as interviewing and reviewing artists throughout FreshFringe 2018. I&rsquo;m active in the arts, including Bedlam Theatre, FilmSoc, and past work with Underbelly, and I hope to use these connections to get many more people involved in the Arts Team next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Head of Arts</strong> - <em>Jessica Cave</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Jessica Cave, and I&rsquo;m running to be Head of Arts next year. Although I was not involved in the art team directly last year, this does not mean I was not an avid member of the Freshair community. I have ran my show all year and co-host a couple of my friend&#39;s shows.&nbsp; Last year I decided to focus my time between Music Team&rsquo;s meetings and News team where I write articles each week on current events. But it is not as if I am shy from the arts around Edinburgh - In fact, I ran the arts section for news team. My goals for Head of Arts are as follows: I will to create stronger links between the arts-team and other ECA and other EUSA arts-based venues to engage more listeners by having interviews on-air, live performances on air so the team becomes known throughout the uni arts world. I will also create a community of hosts for the arts-team hub-show like with Newsteam where there is an emphasis on community family-like feel about the enviroment. I also will up the advertisement for the arts-team where people around the uni other than FreshAir will know the name by putting flyers up and offering artists to come on air to advertise shows it will engage more listeners to the show. Vote for me, and you will have a fun, organised arts-team host who is dedicated to making next year anenjoyable and successful year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Head of News</strong> - <em>Ella Kopeikin</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hello, my name is Ella Kopeikin and I&rsquo;m excited to run for Head of News next year. Never one to shy away from a microphone, in my first year as a student at Edinburgh I have been a very active member of Freshair. I have my own show, It&rsquo;s All Happening, in which I discuss a genre and decade of music and its history and am also a loyal member of Freshair news. Each week for news I write articles, travel pieces, the occasional movie review, choose songs for the week&rsquo;s theme, and tie up any extra loose ends. Plus, this semester I&rsquo;ve taken over running tech for the team. My ideas for news next year are in two parts. First, this year I was one of only 3 or 4 people on the team and while we grew to be like family, I want to encourage more people to join. I plan to do this by updating the Freshair news page weekly with team pieces, providing articles and interviews which will hopefully make the team less daunting and the news community more accessible. Next, because of the preparation and amount of talking the team requires news tends to be seen as one of Freshair&rsquo;s less groovy groups. My idea to change this is to emphasise the perspective of each team member so people tune in not just for the week&rsquo;s news but for the personality of the show. Overall, I want Freshair news to be both informative and fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Design Manager</strong> - <em>Millie Player</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Millie and I&rsquo;m running for design manager. I am currently a first year History student, although I do have a creative background. I completed an art foundation diploma at Falmouth University, and was previously going to study fine art photography at GSA. I have experience in a variety of art mediums and worked with people in many artistic areas on my foundation course. Therefore, I have an understanding of merging different ideas and techniques to create a piece of work, or in this case design content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I recently noticed the logo change for Fresh Air and I really see the potential in visually spreading the branding of Fresh Air around University locations to increase awareness. Additionally, I think that the station could really benefit from selling Fresh Air merch at events; for example t-shirts, posters and stickers. To do this I think that we should collaborate frequently with ECA, whether that be through working with artists, or providing music for Art exhibitions or events where we could promote the creative side of the station.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Webmaster</strong> - <em>Yu-Jo Tseng and Samuel MacLeod</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a webmaster, next year I&#39;d like to work towards a more reliable streaming infrastructure, one that has a more stable connection and does not fail as frequently. This would improve the experience of both presenters who have limited time allocated to them for live shows and listeners who probably don&#39;t want their ears blasted by Beyonce cutting in for a second. This would involve looking at different tech stacks that we could use instead of Liquidsoap and possibly also existing paid solutions if our budget allows for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another thing I&#39;d like to work on but is less of a priority is adding more features to the website, which was something we unfortunately didn&#39;t get to this year due to streaming difficulties. Some ideas we&#39;ve come up with include better sorting of shows, a subscription system and a better admin user interface. Of course we will discuss with the committee before making any changes to the website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will continue to support the committee and our members with any tech issues. Next year I&#39;ll also be graduating (hopefully) so I&#39;ll start looking for a replacement webmaster towards the end of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Technical Manager</strong> - <em>Olesya Lesyk</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Make tech more accessible through making a tech cheat sheet with common problems with solutions.</li>\r\n	<li>Getting more people hands on with tech through workshops etc.</li>\r\n	<li>Get a proper plan in place in order to replace the desk and work with web team to put in motion a plan for better infastructure for the future.</li>\r\n	<li>Grow Freshair and promote it with in theatre technical circles to get more people involved and interested in the behind the scenes of the station.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Social Secretary</strong> - <em>Jen Logan</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I feel like I&rsquo;d make a good social secretary because I&rsquo;m genuinely enthusiastic about the purpose of the role. It can be very easy to be quite insular in FreshAir and just go along to your show once a week, and socials help to challenge that. I&rsquo;d love to try increase the amount of socials, even very casual ones, and make sure they&rsquo;re advertised to members on multiple platforms to make them as accessible as possible and ensure people are getting the most out of their FreshAir experience! I really believe in the families idea and think I&rsquo;d enjoy executing it. As a relatively new member and presenter I can remember what it&rsquo;s like to be finding your feet and still feel like I am in lots of ways. If the option had been available to me I know I definitely would&rsquo;ve taken it as I&rsquo;m sure lots of others would, and I believe it has the potential to be extremely helpful to members and encourage people to sign up that wouldn&rsquo;t have before due to nervousness about learning how the society works. The meet the parents social also seems like a really fun idea and I think including some team building and get to know me elements would be fab. Overall I think I can bring what I&rsquo;ve learned over the past year to the role and help ensure the members of FreshAir are having the best possible experience they can and making the society as fun and sociable as it can be.</p>\r\n', 2, '2017-06-21 11:01:23', '2019-03-28 18:39:30', 'election-manifestos', NULL),
