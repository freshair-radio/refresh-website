## Formatting guide
Wherever on the website you find a visual editor (like for posts, pages and events) you can format text, create tables and so on. You can upload a picture (or embed an external one) by clicking on the ‘Picture’ button. You can add an attachment by clicking on the ‘Link’ button, then on ‘Upload’. You can embed other types of content (like youtube videos) by clicking on the ‘Source’ button in the editor and pasting the relevant HTML code.  Remember to switch back to visual editing.
 Please use as little formatting as possible. Setting your text bold or italic is definitely ok, changing its background-color is almost definitely not ok. Some HTML code you add may be filtered away before being presented to users. If you have any special need on that regard, get in touch with the webmaster.
If you have some systematic issue with formatting, such as the font-size being too small for all posts, get in touch with the webmaster, **do not** systematically manually change the font size yourself.

## Publishing posts
### Tags
You can manage tags through Admin Dashboard > Content > Tags
Please assign the appropriate existing tags (and/or create new ones) before publishing a post. When there is a tag related to an event, and the event becomes past, please add a temporal identifier to the name of the tag (e.g. change 'General Elections' to 'General Elections 2017').

### Posts
You can manage posts through Admin Dashboard > Content > Posts
If you are in a show, you can assign a show to your post. It will then be displayed in your show's page.
If you're in a team, you can assign a team to your post. It will then be displayed in your team's page.
In order for your post to be actually published, make sure that the 'Is published?' checkbox is checked. You can use this feature to write drafts.
You can write a short body for your post, it will be displayed in the multiple posts view. If you don't, it will be automatically generated from the post content.
As for the post content, **please**, refer to the Formatting Guide above.
If your post is displayed under a tag, and it has pictures, the first one will be  selected and displayed. To override this behaviour (select a different picture), click on a picture of your choice, click on the 'Image' button, select the 'Advanced' tab, write 'main' in the 'Id' field and confirm.


### Reviews
If your post is a review, you can add a rating to it (it will be appropriately represented by the website with a 0 to 5 stars graphic). To do so, before publishing a post, add 'Post Metadata' to it, selecting the type 'rating' and inserting a numeric score from 0 to 10.

### Highlighting content
If you're a committee member, or the head of a team, you will be displayed an option in both the Tag Edit view and Post Edit view to highlight the tag or post. The homepage will display the three latest highlights.

You can only highlight content that has a picture associated to it. In the case of a tag, you will be requested to upload it. In the case of a post, the first picture of the post body will automatically be used. If you want to use a different picture for a post, select that picture, click on the 'picture' button on the editor, select the 'Advanced' tab, write 'main' in the 'Id' field and confirm.


## Head of Programming
As the Head of Programming, you'll need to sign up for a user account on the website and request the role 'Head of Programming'.

### Routine
Ideally, before each broadcast cycle you should gather a list of all the users that need to be given access as hosts or producers and e-mail the list to the webmaster. All of them will need to sign up for a user account on the website and request to be given access as Hosts or Producers. You should provide them with indications on how to do so. They will also need to activate their account by clicking a link that should be automatically e-mailed to them. After they create their accounts and the webmaster approves them, you can go on creating shows, and then schedules.

###  Shows
You should be able to create, delete and edit all shows on the website from Admin Dashboard > Programming > Shows

Shows need to have a title and a description. The title must be unique. Shows can have a tag line if desired by their hosts. Ideally, you would upload a show picture; if you don't, a default one will be used for the show. Shows should be assigned hosts. These should then be able to update the details of the shows you assign them to through the Admin Dashboard.

### Schedules
You should be able to create, delete and edit schedules on the website from Admin Dashboard > Programming > Schedules.

Before creating a schedule you should create all the shows you want to add to it. To create a new schedule, pick a descriptive name (e.g. 'Semester1 2017'), set an end date and add *assignments*. Each assignment will consist of a show, a day of the week, a start time and an end time.

You can also mark a schedule as *free schedule*, meaning that users will be able to book the Main Studio through the 'Bookings' tab in the Admin Dashboard and their shows will be assumed to be on-air by the system at the time and date they choose. Free schedules are meant as temporary schedules in transitory periods (e.g. the end of the semester). You can still add standard assignments to a free schedule.

The system won't let you save a schedule with time clashes, either between two assignments or between an assignment and a previous booking. The system won't allow users to make a booking conflicting with a preexisting assignment. You should be able to edit and delete all bookings. Use this power with wisdom.

If you want a given schedule to be a draft, leave both the start date and end date fields empty. The website will use these to determine whether a schedule is current, and will make it accessible to users. The website will also make accessible the most imminent future schedule.

## Hosts and Producers
As a host or producer you'll need to sign up for a user account on the website and to be assigned to a show.

### Shows
You should be able to edit your show details (like the title, description and picture) on the website from Admin Dashboard > Programming > Shows.

### Show recordings
If you are not a System Administrator, you can only access recordings from the studio.
To access recordings, go to studio.freshair.org.uk (where Broadcast Controls are) and click 'Recordings'.

### Podcasts
You should be able to manage your podcasts and create new ones from Admin Dashboard > Contents > Podcasts. To create a new podcast, you should first upload it on MixCloud, as you will need a MixCloud URL to create a new podcast. After this is done, get the newly uploaded podcast's URL (for example by clicking on the 'share' button in the player on MixCloud).
You can add a list of the tracks played on that episode.
If you upload podcasts for a show which has been marked as a Team Hub Show, its
latest podcast will be displayed on the team page.

### Moderating posts
You have the ability of editing and deleting all posts associated to your show, even if you're not the author. Use this power wisely.

### Broadcasting
#### Live shows
In the studio, in order to go on air,  you need to have a user account on the website and to be assigned to a show.
In the Main Studio, just follow these steps:
1. On PC1, open studio.freshair.org.uk in a browser window
2. Enter your email
3. Select the show you're about to broadcast from the list and confirm
4. Click on the 'off air' button. When it becomes red and displays 'on air', well, you're on air

If the studio is already on air from a previous show, remember to logout and login with your credentials! We record these logins to ensure attendance, thus if you fail to do so you might unwillingly get in trouble.

If yours is the last show for the day, please remember to go off air.

#### Pre-recorded shows
Currently you can only upload prerecorded shows from the studio:
1. On PC1, open studio.freshair.org.uk in a browser window
2. Click on 'Upload Prerecording'
3. Enter your email
4. Select the show you want to upload a pre-record for, click confirm
5. Select the time and date you want to broadcast on. Make sure that you have been allocated that time and that the file you're uploading is not too long.
6. Select a file on your computer, click upload

If everything worked out, you will read a comforting 'Upload successful'. To make sure your prerecording goes on air, please upload it at least 24 hours in advance. You should upload an mp3 file. There are other indications on how to export your file and obtain the best results, on the 'Upload prerecording' page.

### Bookings
From the Admin Dashboard of the website, you should be able to book the Recording Studio at any time. In general, please make sure that the period and time you're booking for is bookable. You can't, for example, book the Recording Studio for July the 17th and expect to be granted access.

For your convenience, if you're looking for a bookable time, click on the 'Future' scope above the Bookings list, or on the 'Recording Studio Next 7 Days' scope. You should see a corresponding list of bookings, ordered by booking date and time. You can also make a more specific query by using the 'Filter' sidebar on the right.

## Heads of team
If you are the head of a team, you should sign up for a user account on the website, select your team, and check 'Head of that team'.

### Members
You should instruct all the members of the team on how to sign up for a user account on the website and be assigned to a team. If they fail to assign themselves to teams or need to be added to one after they sign up, you can do so by clicking on 'Teams' on the top menu the Admin Dashboard. You'll see a list of teams you are a head of. Click on 'edit' for the appropriate one. You'll be able to add new team members. When you're done, simply click 'Update Team'.

### Team pages
Each team has a dedicated page on the website. You can personalize the top content of your teams' pages. Following the procedure described in the previous paragraph, click 'edit' on your chosen team, and just edit its 'body' field. Then, click 'Update Team'.
**Please**: before doing anything adventourous with your team's body, like embedding content, get in touch with the webmaster. Refer to the Formatting Guide above at the beginning of this document.

### Moderating posts
You have the ability of editing and deleting all the posts associated to the teams you're a head of. Use this power wisely.

### Hub show
You have the ability of editing the details of your team's show.

## Committee members
If you are a member of the committee you should sign up for a user account on the website and request the role 'Committee Member'.

### Events
You should be able to manage events throgh the Admin Dashboard of the website.
Events will need to have a title, location and start date and time. Optionally, you can add a description (which you can format), an end date and time, a link to a facebook event, and a link to the tickets.
Upcoming events will be displayed in the left sidebar of the website. Newly published events will be displayed in the 'Latest posts' section in the website.
Please only add events relevant to the whole station (a team meeting should not be worth of a website event. You can instead publicize it using the top section in your team's page).
As for the description of the event, **please**, refer to the Formatting Guide above at the beginning of this document.

### Pages
You should be able, through the Admin Dashboard of the website, to edit existing main pages and to create, destroy and edit sub pages. Sub pages need a parent page.
As for their content, **please**, refer to the Formatting Guide above at the beginning of this document.

## Legacy content
The current website was completely rewritten in the summer of 2017. The content from the previous website hasn't been migrated, but it's still live at old.freshair.org.uk.
Thus, if you have a broken link from the old website, just prefix it with "old." and it should magically work.

## Reporting issues
If you experience an issue while using the website (or the Broadcast Controls), please report it through the 'Report an issue' link, at the bottom of the website.

## Other help
If you need revised roles  or have any other query, you can get in touch with webmaster@freshair.org.uk.
