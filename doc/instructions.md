## Publishing posts
### Tags
Please assign the appropriate existing tags (and/or create new) before publishing a post. When there is a tag related to an event, and the event becomes past, please add a temporal identifier to the name of the tag (e.g. change 'General Elections' to 'General Elections 2017').

## Head of Programming
As the Head of Programming, you'll need to sign up for a user account on the website and request the role 'Head of Programming'.

### Routine
Ideally, before each broadcast cycle you should gather a list of all the users that need to be given access as hosts or producers and e-mail the list to the webmaster. All of them will need to sign up for a user account on the website and request to be given access as Hosts or Producers. You should provide them with indications on how to do so. They will also need to activate their account by clicking a link that should be automatically e-mailed to them. After they create their accounts and the webmaster approves them, you can go on creating shows, and then schedules.

###  Shows
You should be able to create, delete and edit all shows on the website from Admin Dashboard > Programming >Shows

Shows need to have a title and a description. The title must be unique. Shows can have a tag line if desired by their hosts. Ideally, you would upload a show picture; if you don't, a default one will be used for the show. Shows should be assigned hosts and producers. They should be able to update the details of the shows you assign them to through the Admin Dashboard.

### Schedules
You should be able to create, delete and edit schedules on the website from Admin Dashboard > Programming > Schedules.

Before creating a schedule you should create all the shows you want to add to it.
To create a new schedule, pick a descriptive name (e.g. 'Semester1 2017'), set an end date and add *assignments*. Each assignment will consist of a show, a day of the week, a start time and an end time.

You can also mark a schedule as *free schedule*, meaning that users will be able to book the Main Studio through the 'Bookings' tab in the Admin Dashboard and their shows will be assumed to be on-air by the system at the time and date they choose. Free schedules are meant as temporary schedules in transitory periods (e.g. the end of the semester). You can still add standard assignments to a free schedule.

The system won't let you save a schedule with time clashes, either between two assignments or between an assignment and a previous booking. The system won't allow users to make a booking conflicting with a pre-existing assignment. You should be able to edit, create and delete all bookings. Use this power with wisdom.

If a schedule is the current schedule, you should set it as *current* in the schedules list view in the Admin Dashboard. Then the schedule will be displayed on the website and will help determine which shows are active and what's their broadcast day and time. You can also set it back as not current. There can only be one current schedule. You cannot set as current a schedule whose end date is in the past.

A current schedule whose end date becomes past will automatically be set as 'not current' and the website will warn users that there is no current schedule. This is to make sure that the information the website holds are always as accurate as possible. To prevent that from happening you can either extend the end date of the current schedule, or
- Create a new, *successor schedule*
- Edit the current schedule that's about to expire and set as the attribute 'Next schedule' the successor schedule you previously created. Then, after the end date passes, the successor schedule will automatically be set as current.

## Hosts and Producers
As a host or producer you'll need to sign up for a user account on the website and to be assigned to a show.

### Shows
You should be able to edit your show details (like the title, description and picture) on the website from Admin Dashboard > Programming > Shows.


### Show recordings
If you are not a System Administrator, you can only access recordings from the studio.
To access recordings, go to studio.freshair.org.uk (where Broadcast Controls are) and click 'Recordings'.

### Podcasts
You should be able to manage your podcasts and create new ones from Admin Dashboard > Contents > Podcasts. To create a new podcast, you should first upload it on MixCloud, as you will need a MixCloud URL to create a new podcast. After this is done, get the newly uploaded podcast's URL (for example by clicking on the 'share' button in the player on MixCloud).

### Broadcasting
#### Live shows
In the studio, in order to go on air,  you need to have a user account on the website and to be assigned the role 'Host or Producer'.
In the Main Studio, just follow these steps:
1. On PC1, open studio.freshair.org.uk in a browser window
2. Enter your email
3. Select the show you're about to broadcast from the list and confirm
4. Click on the 'off air' button. When it becomes red and displays 'on air', well you're on air

#### Pre-recorded shows
Currently you can only upload prerecorded shows from the studio:
1. On PC1, open studio.freshair.org.uk in a browser window
2. Enter your email
3. Select the show you want to upload a pre-record for
4. [ documentation incomplete]

### Bookings
From the Admin Dashboard of the website, you should be able to book the Recording Studio at any time, and to book the Main Studio when a 'free schedule' is in place (you should be notified by the Head of Programming if this is the case). In general, please make sure that the period and time you're booking for is bookable. You can't, for example, book the Recording Studio for July the 17th and expect to be granted access.

For your convenience, if you're looking for a bookable time, click on the 'Future' scope above the Bookings list, or on the 'Recording Studio Next 7 Days' scope. You should see a corresponding list of bookings, ordered by booking date and time. You can also make a more specific query by using the 'Filter' sidebar on the right.

## Committee members
If you are a member of the committee you should sign up for a user account on the website and request the role 'Committee Member'.

### Events
You should be able to manage events throgh the Admin Dashboard of the website.
Events will need to have a title, location and start date and time. Optionally, you can add a description (which you can format), an end date and time, a link to a facebook event, and a link to the tickets.
Upcoming events will be displayed in the left sidebar of the website. Newly published events will be displayed in the 'Latest posts' section in the website.
Please only add events relevant to the whole station (a team meeting should not be worth of a website event. You can instead publicize it using the top section in your team's page).

### Highlights
You can highlight a playlist, event, review, interview, podcast, generic post or tag. An highlighted content will be displayed in the top section of the homepage. You should **only** highlight something very important to the station, not just some content you wrote you want to give visibility to, and you should seek the committee approval.

### Pages
You should be able, through the Admin Dashboard of the website, to edit existing main pages and to create, destroy and edit sub pages.


## Music Team
If you're a member of the Music Team, you should sign up for a user account on the website and be assigned the role 'Music Team Member'
### Playlists
You should be able to manage playlists through the Admin Dashboard of the website.
A playlist will need to have a title. You can add tracks to the playlist by specifying a track title, an artist, an album, and embed data. Remember to add the relevant tags to your playlist! The most recent playlist with the tag 'weekly music team playlist' will be displayed in TODO.
Newly published playlists will be displayed in the 'Latest posts' section in the website.

## Other help
If you need revised roles  or have any other query, you can get in touch with webmaster@freshair.org.uk.
